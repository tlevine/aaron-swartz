    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Is Aaron a cofounder of Reddit.com?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy to see from the historical record. For example, when Reddit was acquired by Condé Nast, they and Reddit jointly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.condenastdigital.com/press/condenet/release_oct312006.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;issued a press release&lt;/a&gt; which called Aaron a founder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The deal was announced today by Kourosh Karimkhany, General Manager of Wired Digital; &lt;strong&gt;the four founders of Reddit: Steve Huffman, Alexis Ohanian, Aaron Swartz&lt;/strong&gt;, and Chris Slowe; and Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, the venture firm that provided funding for Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham, Reddit's major investor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1octb/reddit_cofounder_aaron_swartz_discusses_how_he/c1okmc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;also confirmed&lt;/a&gt; Aaron was a founder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aaron's not wrong to call himself one of the founders.&lt;/strong&gt; The company behind Reddit was a merger of two startups ... and in that situation the founders of both startups are considered founders of the combined company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, there's absolutely no historical evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
