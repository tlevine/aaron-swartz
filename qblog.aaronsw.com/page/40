        <blockquote class="thequote">[We] were crammed with learning as cynically as a goose is crammed for Christmas. And with what learning! This business of making a gifted boy&#8217;s career depend on a competitive examination, taken when he is only twelve or thirteen is an evil thing at best, but there do appear to be preparatory schools which send scholars to Eton, Winchester, etc. without teaching them to see everything in terms of marks. At St Cyprian&#8217;s the whole process was frankly a preparation for a sort of confidence trick. Your job was to learn exactly those things that would give an examiner the impression that you knew more than you did know, and as far as possible to avoid burdening your brain with anything else. Subjects which lacked examination-value, such as geography, were almost completely neglected, mathematics was also neglected if you were a ‘classical’, science was not taught in any form — indeed it was so despised that even an interest in natural history was discouraged — and even the books you were encouraged to read in your spare time were chosen with one eye on the ‘English paper’. Latin and Greek, the main scholarship subjects, were what counted, but even these were deliberately taught in a flashy, unsound way. We never, for example, read right through even a single book of a Greek or Latin author: we merely read short passages which were picked out because they were the kind of thing likely to be set as an ‘unseen translation’. During the last year or so before we went up for our scholarships, most of our time was spent in simply working our way through the scholarship papers of previous years. Sambo had sheaves of these in his possession, from every one of the major public schools. But the greatest outrage of all was the teaching of history.</blockquote>

I think that shows not just confusion but moral defect. But really, they never boil my blood. Ezra’s around my age and is like lots of snarky lefty guys I knew in school. I feel like I “get” his “snark + analysis” thing and for fun I usually imagine him in his DC flat cooking with a gaggle of not-that-hot liberal girls wearing “I only sleep with Democrats” buttons, regaling them with stories about meeting powerful lefty politicians before he beds them simultaneously and in fast-forward, Clockwork Orange Style.

        <blockquote class="thequote">Lunches at Moses&#8217; office were really starting to get pretty sickening,&#8221; recalls one top La Guardia official. &#8220;Even if he only had one guest, he would always have six or eight of his &#8216;Moses Men&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;my muchachoes,&#8217; he used to call them&#8212;at the table and it was all &#8216;Yes, sir, RM,&#8217; &#8216;No, sir, RM,&#8217; &#8216;Right as usual, RM!&#8221; When he laughed, they laughed, only louder&#8212;you know what I mean. Christ, when he made a statement, you could look around the table and see eight heads nodding practically in unison. It was like a goddamned Greek chorus.</blockquote>
