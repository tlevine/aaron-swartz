Abstract

   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) for use by
   those with OpenPGP keys.  OpenPGP is a standardized public-key
   cryptosystem that provides for digital signatures and encryption.
   This namespace can be used in conjunction with OpenPGP to ensure
   reliability of the data by means of a digital signature.

Internet-Draft        A URN Namespace for PGP Users            July 2002


1. Introduction

   OpenPGP, defined by the OpenPGP IETF Working Group, is a set of
   standards providing interoperability between public-key cryptography
   software.  Public-key cryptography identifies users by means of their
   keypair, which can be thought of a large random number.  The first of
   these, the public key, is made publicly available.  However, since it
   is often too long for most humans to deal with (saying, checking
   equality, etc.), a shorter "fingerprint" (hash of the public key) is
   generally used for identification.

   This namespace allows users with a public key fingerprint a personal
   namespace which they can use for any resources they wish.  This
   namespace provides not only a decentralized method of allocation to
   anyone who can run OpenPGP-compatible software, but also provides a
   means for verifying data about these names via digital signatures.

2. Specification Template

   This is an NID registration as specified in RFC 2611 [1].

      Namespace ID: "pgp" requested

      Registration Information

         Registration Version Number: 1

         Registration Date: 2002-07-08

      Declared registrant of the namespace:

         Aaron Swartz
         me@aaronsw.com
         349 Marshman
         Highland Park, IL 60035
         USA

      Declaration of syntactic structure:

         All URIs will start with "urn:pgp:" followed by the uppercase
         hex representation of the key fingerprint with no whitespace,
         followed by another colon.  For example:

           urn:pgp:4FAC4838B7D8D13FA6D92EDB4145521E79F0DF4B:

         The user may add any valid URI characters after that and decide
         what resource is identified by the resulting URI.

      Relevant ancillary documentation:

         OpenPGP is defined by RFC 2440 [2] which includes a
         specification of the fingerprint format in section 11.2.

      Identifier uniqueness considerations:

         The OpenPGP designers have gone to great lengths to ensure that
         their fingerprints will have as few collisions as possible.
         After that, the space is partitioned such that each keyholder
         is responsible for respecting the uniqueness rules.

      Identifier persistence considerations

         Since documents identified by this URN namespace can be
         digitally signed and easily verified, they can continue to be
         mirrored and redistributed around the network with no loss in
         authenticity.

      Process for identifier resolution:

         Not applicable.

      Validation mechanism:

         Valid URNs in this namespace will match this regular
         expression:

           urn:pgp:[0-9A-F]+:

         followed by any series of valid URI characters.


3. Examples

   The following examples are not guaranteed to be real URNs.  They are
   simply examples of syntactically valid ones under this scheme.

           urn:pgp:4FAC4838B7D8D13FA6D92EDB4145521E79F0DF4B:bob/joe?sally=sue
           urn:pgp:6D3A1FA30AE5B634E484E0EBF7177452:2002/05/07/borkingPoint


4. IANA Considerations

   This document calls for registration of a new URN namespace,
   according to the registration template in section 2.
