## [What Happens in _The Dark Knight_](tdk)

_Spoilers, obviously._

As we've discussed, in [_Batman
Begins_](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/batmanbegins) 1960s-style full
employment and antipoverty programs lead to skyrocketing crime while in [_The
Dark Knight Rises_](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdkr) 1980s-style tough-on-
crime policies and neoliberal economics lead to a revolt of the economic
underclass. The films are mirror images, one about the failure of liberal
policies; the other about the failure of conservative policies. In this sense,
_The Dark Knight_ is truly the final film in this nihilistic trilogy,
documenting the hopelessness of anything outside that usual left-right
struggle.

From the start, the city is torn about how to handle the Batman, who has
inspired a wave of second-rate imitators. Some believe it's wrong to be
idolizing a masked vigilante, but most (including the new DA, Harvey Dent)
approve of his results.

Dent is doing his own part to lock up the criminals, working inside the
system. He's arrested all the mob bankers (except Lau) and is now going after
the gangsters themselves, starting with mob boss Maroni (who took over for mob
boss Falcone). But while the prosecutions bring him a great deal of political
attention, they don't seem to achieve much in the way of concrete results --
new gangsters spring up to take the place of whoever Dent arrests.

Dent decides the only way to win is to go big -- really big. He arrests
everyone at once, on charges that are unlikely to stick. Dent doesn't care
that he's breaking the rules, as long as it solves the problem. He cites the
Romans who suspended democracy to protect their city. (Although, as Rachel
points out, they ended up losing democracy.) "You either die a hero or you
live long enough to see yourself become the villain," Dent explains. He hopes
to take up Batman's mantle, but do it from inside the system.

But, as the mayor explains, Dent isn't just taking on his own sense of ethics,
he's taking on the entire system: "the mob, politicians, journalists, cops --
anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter". If he fails, both of their
careers are over.

Just as Dent is frustrated with the justice system, the Joker is frustrated
with the criminals. He tells them they need to go big: they need to kill the
Batman. He offers to do it for a sizable sum of money, which the gangsters
eventually agree to. The Joker is obsessed with the _homo economicus_ of game
theory (from whence his name?): when the gangsters ask why he needs the money
to kill the Batman, he explains "Like my mother used to tell me: if you're
good at something, never do it for free."

The film opens with the Joker hiring five men to rob a mob bank: Dopey
silences the alarm, Happy shoots him and drills through the vault, Grumpy
shoots him and empties the cash into duffel bags, a bus runs him over, Bozo
shoots the bus driver. Finally, Bozo pulls off his mask to reveal he's the
Joker. This is a classic [pirate
game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game) and, just as in the theory,
the Joker gets to keep almost all the cash.

Batman eventually tries to track down the Joker by threatening the gangster
Maroni. But it's no use, as Maroni explains: "No one's gonna tell you anything
--they're wise to your act--you got rules. The Joker, he's got no rules. No
one's gonna cross him for you." This is a straightforward application of game
theory's [Davies-Folk theorem](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/11/29
/reputations-are-made-of/): the rational thing is to seem irrational so your
opponents can't count on you doing the rational thing.

Alfred sees this quickly, because it reminds him of a story from his own past:

> I was in Burma. A long time ago. My friends and I were working for the local
government. They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders, bribing
them with precious stones. But their caravans were being raided in a forest
north of Rangoon by a bandit. We were asked to take care of the problem, so we
started looking for the stones. But after six months, we couldn't find
_anyone_ who had traded with him. … One day I found a child playing with a
ruby as big as a tangerine. … The bandit had been throwing the stones away. …
Some men just want to watch the world burn.

Note the parallels. In Alfred's story the entire status quo (including the
local government and tribal leaders) is totally corrupt: _the official plan_
is to bribe people. But the plan is defeated by someone even crazier, someone
willing to steal the money but not interested in keeping it for himself.

Sure enough, when the Joker finally does get his hands on the money, he merely
lights it on fire.

Meanwhile, Dent's ethical compromises begin to grow and grow. When he kidnaps
one of the Joker's thugs, he tries to threaten information out of him. This is
something Batman does routinely, but Batman reminds Dent that Dent can't get
away with that sort of thing -- it'd destroy his credibility as an insider.

In a climactic scene, the Batman finally confronts the Joker in the middle of
the street. The Joker knows Batman lives by just one rule ("I will not be an
executioner") and encourages him to break it and kill him. But Batman can't
bring himself to do it, he swerves at a key moment and ends up smashed while
the Joker survives. (Yep: the Joker has just won the game of
[chicken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)).)

When he comes to, the Joker tells Batman that despite nominally working
outside the system, he's actually just the system's pawn:

> To them you're a freak like me. They just need you right now. … But as soon
as they don't, they'll cast you out like a leper. … Their morals, their code…
it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as
the world _allows_ them to be. You'll see--I'll show you…

>

> You have these rules. And you think they'll save you. … [But t]he only
sensible way to live in this world is _without_ rules.

Gordon arrests the Joker and takes him to the major crimes unit, only to find
the Joker claiming Gordon does not actually control the unit -- his people
actually working for mob boss Maroni. "Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to
know how alone you are?" he asks (a classic [principal-agent
problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem)).

The Joker has kidnapped both Dent and Rachel and set them both to blow so that
Batman can only rescue one ([opportunity
cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost)). Batman goes to rescue
Rachel but the Joker has switched their addresses and he actually ends up
rescuing Dent1. Rachel dies and Dent loses half his face, becoming Two-Face.

Reese, one of Bruce Wayne's employees goes on TV and threatens to reveal the
identity of the Batman, but the Joker calls in and asks him to stop. "I had a
vision," he says. "Of a world without Batman. The mob ground out a little
profit and the police tried to shut them down, one block at a time… and it was
so… boring. I've had a change of heart." He threatens to blow up a hospital
unless someone kills Reese. (He has thus constructed a [trolley
problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem): people must decide
whether it's better to let the 100 die or kill the 1.)

At the hospital, the Joker explains things to Dent:

> Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Harvey? I don't have a plan… The
mob has plans, the cops have plans. … Maroni has plans. Gordon has plans.
Schemers trying to control their worlds. I'm not a schemer, I show the
schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.

>

> It's the schemers who put you where you are. You were a schemer. You had
plans. Look where it got you. … Nobody panics when the _expected_ people get
killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is
horrifying. If I tell the press that tomorrow a gangbanger will get shot, or a
truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics. Because it's all part
of the plan. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, everybody
loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order
and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. And you know the thing
about chaos, Harvey? … It's _fair_.

This pushes Dent over the edge. He starts going after everyone responsible for
killing Rachel: He starts with Weurtz, who kidnapped him. Weurtz gives up
Maroni, who points to Ramirez, who helps him get Gordon's family, who
naturally gets Gordon.

Batman, meanwhile, is also crossing lines. In his attempt to find the Joker,
he has turned every cell phone into a spy device. Even he admits this might be
too much power for one man to have.

The Joker scares the city onto its two ferries. Once the ferries are in the
middle of the water, he cuts their power and gives them both a button to blow
up the other ferry, thereby constructing a [prisoner's
dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) (one boat is filled
with real prisoners). The passengers discuss and vote. One of the prisoners
makes a [Ulysses pact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact) and
[credibly commits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency) by
tossing the detonator overboard.

The Joker also took a busload of people from the hospital to the Prewitt
Building where, through the window, you can see Joker's thugs with guns
holding hospital people hostage. Gordon rushes in to get the thugs, but Batman
discovers the thugs are hostages and the hostages are the thugs. (The Joker is
illustrating ["The Market for
Lemons"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons): if the Joker is
making it easy for you to kill his henchmen, why should you believe they're
actually his henchmen?)

(Batman saves the hostages (dressed as thugs) and stops the SWAT team and
takes out the thugs (dressed as hostages). Neither of the boats decides to
blow up the other and Batman prevents the Joker from triggering the failsafe.)

He then goes to rescue Gordon, who is trying to stop Dent from killing his
family. Dent explains his new philosophy:

> You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time. You thought we could
lead by example. You thought the rules could be bent but not break…2 you were
wrong. The world is cruel. And the only morality in a cruel world is chance.
Unbiased. Unprejudiced. _Fair._

Throughout the film, we've seen various desperate attempts to change the
system by ignoring the usual rules: Batman originally thought he could inspire
change by being a cultural exemplar, but only ended up causing a bunch of kids
to get themselves hurt by dressing up as him. Dent thought he could clean up
the system by pushing righteously from the inside, but ended up cutting more
and more ethical corners until his own personal obsessions ended up making him
a monster. The Joker had by far the most interesting plan: he hoped to out-
corrupt the corrupters, to take their place and give the city "a better class
of criminal".

And the crazy thing is that it works! At the end of the movie, the Joker is
alive, the gangsters and their money launderers are mostly dead, and their
money has been redistributed (albeit though the deflationary method of setting
it on fire). And, as we see from the beginning of the third movie, this is a
fairly stable equilibrium: with politicians no longer living in fear of the
gangsters, they're free to adopt tough anti-crime policies that keep them from
rising again.3

The movie concludes by emphasizing that Batman must become the villain, but as
usual it never stops to notice that the Joker is actually the hero. But even
though his various games only have one innocent casualty, he's much too crazy
to be a viable role model for Batman. His inspired chaos destroys the
criminals, but it also terrorizes the population. Thanks to Batman, society
doesn't devolve into a self-interested war of all-against-all, as he
apparently expects it to, but that doesn't mean anyone enjoys the trials.

Thus Master Wayne is left without solutions. Out of options, it's no wonder
the series ends with his staged suicide.

  1. I'm actually not sure which game this is supposed to be. It's a bit like the poisoned goblets game in _The Princess Bride_, but I can't find a name for it in the literature. ↩

  3. This also explains why the law-and-order crowd seems so miffed about succeeding -- it wasn't actually their policies that succeeded. ↩

## [How Looper Works](looperexplained)

First off, go see _Looper_. One of the best movies I've seen. Spoilers follow.

OK, let's start by explaining how a looper's career is supposed to look. You
get hired as a looper, spend your time sitting in a corn field shooting
people, eventually shoot yourself and get a big payday, live off of it for
thirty more years, then get kidnapped and sent back in time and shot by
yourself. Notice that this is a stable timeloop: young you grows old, goes
back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old, goes back in time, gets
shot by young you, who grows old … etc.

But time travel doesn't eliminate free will. We see this with the case of Seth
(Paul Dano / Frank Brennan). Instead of shooting Old Seth, Young Seth decides
to let him escape. This too is a stable timeloop: young Seth grows old, goes
back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while young Seth grows old, goes back
in time, escapes, lives in hiding while … .

But other characters have free will too: young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)
decides to give young Seth up. The gang cuts off one of young Seth's fingers,
pushing him into a new timeloop: young Seth gets caught, loses one of his
fingers, goes back in time, escapes, while young Seth gets caught, loses one
of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, etc. With each new choice by the
gang to let old Seth change young Seth's future (and thus old Seth's past), we
head into a new timeloop, where old Seth has a different past (and thus
different memories and different missing limbs).

In the first main timeloop (shown second in the movie, via a flashback), young
Joe shoots old Joe, goes to China, becomes an unusually-talented agent of
violence, finds true love, is kidnapped and sent back in time, and gets killed
by young Joe, who goes on to do the same thing. This too is a nice stable
timeloop.

But on one of these runs through the loop, old Joe manages to overpower the
guards and, while he does go back in time, he manages to keep young Joe from
killing him. He escapes into the field, finds the location of young Cid, then
comes back to shoot Cid's mother while Cid escapes into field and stows away
on a train. Cid grows up to be the Rainmaker and Joe grows old. Cid's henchmen
murder old Joe's wife but are overpowered by old Joe, who goes back in time to
try again to kill Cid, who again escapes to become the Rainmaker and kill
Joe's wife. This too is a stable timeloop, although we see some of it only in
speculative flash-forwards (I'll explain why in a moment).

Which timeloop are we watching? Well, we're watching the story of a particular
instance of Joe, who we'll call Movie Joe. Movie Joe only exists, however,
because of a choice made by Flashback Joe (the Joe we see in the flashback
that begins when Movie Joe is falling from his apartment). Flashback Joe is
born, grows up, decides to give up Seth, closes his own loop, grows old,
overpowers the henchmen, goes back in time, knocks out Movie Joe, hunts down
Cid, and is about to kill Cid's mother.

But Flashback Joe is not the protagonist of the film. The protagonist is Movie
Joe. Movie Joe is born, grows up, decides to give up Seth, fails to close his
loop, goes to protect Cid. Normally, young Joe fails and heads into a timeloop
where Cid stows away on the train and becomes the Rainmaker. But Movie Joe
somehow is able to foresee this future and concludes the only way to prevent
it is to kill himself. Since he dies there, he never grows old and never goes
back in time, leading to a timeline where Flashback Joe doesn't ever exist.
Note, this is not a stable timeloop (because Movie Joe only kills himself to
stop Flashback Joe, who can't exist if Movie Joe kills himself) but instead
just a garden-variety timeline. In this timeline, presumably, Sarah keeps Cid
from growing evil and everything ends happily ever after.

Next week we'll explain _Primer_.

## [Fix the machine, not the person](nummi)

_This post is part seven of the series [Raw Nerve](rawnerve)._

The General Motors plant in Fremont was a disaster. "Everything was a fight,"
the head of the union admits. "They spent more time on grievances and on
things like that than they did on producing cars. They had strikes all the
time. It was just chaos constantly. … It was considered the worst workforce in
the automobile industry in the United States."

"One of the expressions was, you can buy anything you want in the GM plant in
Fremont," adds Jeffrey Liker, a professor who studied the plant. "If you want
sex, if you want drugs, if you want alcohol, it's there. During breaks, during
lunch time, if you want to gamble illegally--any illegal activity was
available for the asking within that plant." Absenteeism was so bad that some
mornings they didn't have enough employees to start the assembly line; they
had to go across the street and drag people out of the bar.

When management tried to punish workers, workers tried to punish them right
back: scratching cars, loosening parts in hard-to-reach places, filing union
grievances, sometimes even building cars unsafely. It was war.

In 1982, GM finally closed the plant. But the very next year, when Toyota was
planning to start its first plant in the US, it decided to partner with GM to
reopen it, hiring back the same old disastrous workers into the very same
jobs. And so began the most fascinating experiment in management history.

Toyota flew this rowdy crew to Japan, to see an entirely different way of
working: The Toyota Way. At Toyota, labor and management considered themselves
on the same team; when workers got stuck, managers didn't yell at them, but
asked how they could help and solicited suggestions. It was a revelation. "You
had union workers--grizzled old folks that had worked on the plant floor for
30 years, and they were hugging their Japanese counterparts, just absolutely
in tears," recalls their Toyota trainer. "And it might sound flowery to say 25
years later, but they had had such a powerful emotional experience of learning
a new way of working, a way that people could actually work together
collaboratively--as a team."

Three months after they got back to the US and reopened the plant, everything
had changed. Grievances and absenteeism fell away and workers started saying
they actually enjoyed coming to work. The Fremont factory, once one of the
worst in the US, had skyrocketed to become the best. The cars they made got
near-perfect quality ratings. And the cost to make them had plummeted. It
wasn't the workers who were the problem; it was the system.1

* * *

An organization is not just a pile of people, it's also a set of structures.
It's almost like a machine made of men and women. Think of an assembly line.
If you just took a bunch of people and threw them in a warehouse with a bunch
of car parts and a manual, it'd probably be a disaster. Instead, a careful
structure has been built: car parts roll down on a conveyor belt, each worker
does one step of the process, everything is carefully designed and routinized.
Order out of chaos.

And when the system isn't working, it doesn't make sense to just yell at the
people in it -- any more than you'd try to fix a machine by yelling at the
gears. True, sometimes you have the wrong gears and need to replace them, but
more often you're just using them in the wrong way. When there's a problem,
you shouldn't get angry with the gears -- you should fix the machine.

If you have goals in life, you're probably going to need some sort of
organization. Even if it's an organization of just you, it's still helpful to
think of it as a kind of machine. You don't need to do every part of the
process yourself -- you just need to set up the machine so that the right
outcomes happen.

For example, let's say you want to build a treehouse in the backyard. You're
great at sawing and hammering, but architecture is not your forte. You build
and build, but the treehouses keep falling down. Sure, you can try to get
better at architecture, develop a better design, but you can also step back,
look at the machine as a whole, and decide to fire yourself as the architect.
Instead, you find a friend who loves that sort of thing to design the
treehouse for you and you stick to actually building it. After all, your goal
was to build a treehouse whose design you like -- does it really matter
whether you're the one who actually designed it?2

Or let's say you really want to get in shape, but never remember to exercise.
You can keep beating yourself up for your forgetfulness, or you can put a
system in place. Maybe you have your roommate check to see that you exercise
before you leave your house in the morning or you set a regular time to
consistently go to the gym together. Life isn't a high school exam; you don't
have to solve your problems on your own.

* * *

In 1967, Edward Jones and Victor Harris gathered a group of college students
and asked them to judge another student's exam (the student was a fictional
character, but let's call him Jim). The exam always had one question, asking
Jim to write an essay on Fidel Castro "as if [he] were giving the opening
statement in a debate." But what sort of essay Jim was supposed to write
varied: some of them required Jim to write a _defense_ of Castro, others
required Jim to write a _critique_ of Castro, the rest left the choice up to
Jim. The kids in the experiment were asked to read Jim's essay and then were
asked whether they thought Jim himself was pro- or anti-Castro.

Jones and Harris weren't expecting any shocking results here; their goal was
just to show the obvious: that people would conclude Jim was pro-Castro when
he voluntarily chose write to a pro-Castro essay, but not when he was forced
to by the teacher. But what they found surprised them: even when the students
could easily see the question _required_ Jim to write a pro-Castro essay, they
still rated Jim as significantly more pro-Castro. It seemed hard to believe.
"Perhaps some of the subjects were inattentive and did not clearly understand
the context," they suspected.

So they tried again. This time they explained the essay was written for a
debate tournament, where the student had been randomly assigned to either the
for or against side of the debate. They wrote it in big letters on the
blackboard, just to make this perfectly clear. But again they got the same
results -- even more clearly this time. They still couldn't believe it. Maybe,
they figured, students thought Jim's arguments were so compelling he must
really believe them to be able to come up with them.

So they tried a third time -- this time recording Jim on tape along with the
experimenter _giving him the arguments_ to use. Surely no one would think Jim
came up with them on his own now. Again, the same striking results: students
were persuaded Jim believed the arguments he said, even when they knew he had
no choice in making them.3

This was an extreme case, but we make the same mistake all the time. We see a
sloppily-parked car and we think "what a terrible driver," not "he must have
been in a real hurry." Someone keeps bumping into you at a concert and you
think "what a jerk," not "poor guy, people must keep bumping into him." A
policeman beats up a protestor and we think "what an awful person," not "what
terrible training." The mistake is so common that in 1977 Lee Ross decided to
name it the "fundamental attribution error": we attribute people's behavior to
their personality, not their situation.4

* * *

Our natural reaction when someone screws up is to get mad at them. This is
what happened at the old GM plant: workers would make a mistake and management
would yell and scream. If asked to explain the yelling, they'd probably say
that since people don't like getting yelled at, it'd teach them be more
careful next time.

But this explanation doesn't really add up. Do you think the workers liked
screwing up? Do you think they enjoyed making crappy cars? Well, we don't have
to speculate: we know the very same workers, when given the chance to do good
work, took pride in it and started actually enjoying their jobs.

They're just like you, when you're trying to exercise but failing. Would it
have helped to have your friend just yell and scream at you for being such a
lazy loser? Probably not -- it probably would have just made you feel worse.
What worked wasn't yelling, but changing the system around you so that it was
easier to do what you already wanted to do.

The same is true for other people. Chances are, they don't _want_ to annoy
you, they don't like screwing up. So what's going to work isn't yelling at
them, but figuring out how to change the situation. Sometimes that means
changing how you behave. Sometimes that means bringing another person into the
mix. And sometimes it just means simple stuff, like changing the way things
are laid out or putting up reminders.

At the old GM plant, in Fremont, workers were constantly screwing things up:
"cars with engines put in backwards, cars without steering wheels or brakes.
Some were so messed up they wouldn't start, and had to be towed off the line."
Management would yell at the workers, but what could you do? Things were
moving so fast. "A car a minute don't seem like it's moving that fast," noted
one worker, "but when you don't get it, you're in the hole. There's nobody to
pull you out at General Motors, so you're going to let something go."

At the Toyota plant, they didn't just let things go. There was a red cord
running above the assembly line, known as an andon cord, and if you ever found
yourself in the hole, all you had to do was pull it, and the whole line would
stop. Management would come over and ask you how they could help, if there was
a way they could fix the problem. And they'd actually listen -- and do it!

You saw the results all over the factory: mats and cushions for the workers to
kneel on; hanging shelves traveling along with the cars, carrying parts;
special tools invented specifically to solve problems the workers had
identified. Those little things added up to make a big difference.

When you're upset with someone, all you want to do is change the way they're
acting. But you can't control what's inside a person's head. Yelling at them
isn't going to make them come around, it's just going to make them more
defiant, like the GM workers who keyed the cars they made.

No, you can't force other people to change. You can, however, change just
about everything else. And usually, that's enough.

## [Cherish mistakes](geremiah)

_This post is part six of the series [Raw Nerve](rawnerve)._

This is a tale of two nonprofits.

At one, they hate making mistakes. How else could it be? "We're not ever going
to enjoy screwing up," they told me. But this attitude has a lot of
consequences. Everything they do has to go through several layers of approval
to make sure it's not a mistake. And when someone does screw up, they try to
hide it.

It's only natural -- you know you're going to get in trouble for screwing up,
so you try to fix it before anyone notices. And if you can't do, then your
boss or your boss's boss tries. And if no one in the organization can fix it,
and it goes all the way to the executive director, then he tries to figure out
a way to keep it from the press or spin it appropriately, so the world never
finds out they made a mistake.

At the other nonprofit, they have a very different attitude. You notice it the
first time you visit their website. Right in their navigation bar, at the top
of every page, is a link labeled "Mistakes." Click it and you'll find a list
of all the things they screwed up, starting with the most horribly
embarrassing one (they once promoted their group under false names).

And it goes on to discuss mistakes big and small, core and peripheral. They
previously used flaky phones that would cut out during a call, annoying
people. They were insufficiently skeptical in some of the most important
claims they made. At times, their admissions have the tone of a chastised
teenager forced to write an apology, but together they provide a remarkable
record of all the mistakes, both crucial and mundane, you might reasonably
make when starting something new.

It's not that this group likes making mistakes -- you can feel the annoyance
and embarrassment seeping through the page -- but they don't shirk from them
either. They identify their mistake, admit them publicly, and devise steps to
avoid them next time. They use it as an opportunity to get better.

* * *

I [wrote before](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck) about Carol Dweck's
studies of successful and unsuccessful kids, but there's one bit that really
jumped out at me. Given a really tough puzzle to solve, one growth mindset kid
just smiles and says "Mistakes are our friend."1

_Mistakes are our friend._ They can be an exasperating friend sometimes, the
kind whose antics embarrass and annoy, but their heart is in the right place:
they want to help. It's a bad idea to ignore our friends.

That's a hard attitude to take toward mistakes -- they're so embarrassing, our
natural instinct is to want to hide them and cover them up. But that's the
wrong way to think about them. They're actually giving us a gift, because
they're pointing the way toward getting better.

If we try to ignore them, they'll keep nagging at us. We'll run into them
again and again in different guises. You'll say "Don't be silly, that wasn't a
mistake -- I meant to do that." And then you'll eagerly do the same thing next
time ([cognitive dissonance again](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis)).
Or else you'll say "Yes, yes, of course that was a mistake -- it won't happen
again." But as you hurry to move on, you don't change anything, and so it does
happen again.

The trick is to confront the mistake, fess up to what went wrong, and think
about what you can change to keep it from happening again. Usually just
promising not to do it again is not enough: you need to dig into the root
causes and address those.

Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of the Toyota car company, developed a technique
called "Five Why's" for handling this. For example, sometimes a car would come
off the Toyota production line and not start. Why? Well, imagine it was
because the alternator belt had come loose. Most car companies would stop here
and just fix the alternator belt. But Toyoda understood that was dodging the
mistake -- it would just lead it to come back again and again. So he insisted
they keep asking "Why?".

Why was the alternator belt loose? Because it hadn't been put on correctly.
Why? Because the person putting it on didn't double-check to see if it had fit
in correctly. Why? Because he was in too much of a hurry. Why? Because he had
to walk all the way to the other side of the line to get the belts and by the
time he got back he didn't have enough time to double-check.

Aha! There, on the fifth why, we find the real cause of the mistake. And the
solution is easy: move the box of alternator belts closer. But if we'd stopped
at any earlier point (say, by just yelling at the alternator belt guy to
always remember to double-check), we wouldn't have actually fixed the problem.
The same mistake would have happened again and again. Only by digging all the
way to the root cause did we realize we needed to move the box of belts. The
mistake pointed the way to the solution.

The last time I wrote about two nonprofits, someone commented to say they were
"outright nauseated" by my post. "[T]he website is not the place to signal
humility and argue against your own conclusions. All that would demonstrate is
naivety and incompetence," they insisted. And maybe they're right: maybe
having a mistakes page at the top of your website goes much too far.

I've [written before](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis) why I
disagree, but even if they're right that you shouldn't tell the world about
your mistakes, you need to at least tell yourself. It's much too easy to
conveniently forget about all the stuff you screwed up. And so even though it
happens again and again, you never notice the pattern.

By forcing yourself to write it down, to keep a log of the problems you've run
into, you begin to see patterns. You start seeing the things you get better at
and the things you keep flubbing. And then you know what to work on for next
time.

## [Confront reality](anders)

_This post is part five of the series [Raw Nerve](rawnerve)._

We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then,
when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show
that we were right. Intellectually, it is possible to carry on this process
for an indefinite time: the only check on it is that sooner or later a false
belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield.

—George Orwell, "[In Front of Your
Nose](http://orwell.ru/library/articles/nose/english/e_nose)"

If you want to understand experts, you need to start by finding them. So the
psychologists who wanted to understand "expert performance" began by testing
alleged experts, to see how good they really were.

In some fields it was easy: in chess, for example, great players can reliably
beat amateurs. But in other fields, it was much, much harder.

Take punditry. In his giant 20-year study of expert forecasting, Philip
Tetlock found that someone who merely predicted "everything will stay the
same" would be right more often than most professional pundits.1 Or take
therapy. Numerous studies have found an hour with a random stranger is just as
good as an hour with a professional therapist.2 In one study, for example,
sessions with untrained university professors helped neurotic college students
just as much as sessions with professional therapists.3 (This isn't to say
that therapy isn't helpful -- the same studies suggest it is -- it's just that
what's helpful is talking over your problems for an hour, not anything about
the therapist.)

As you might expect, pundits and therapists aren't fans of these studies. The
pundits try to weasel out of them. As Tetlock writes; "The trick is to attach
so many qualifiers to your vague predictions that you will be well positioned
to explain pretty much whatever happens. China will fissure into regional
fiefdoms, but only if the Chinese leadership fails to manage certain trade-
offs deftly, and only if global economic growth stalls for a protracted
period, and only if…"4 The therapists like to point to all the troubled people
they've helped with their sophisticated techniques (avoiding the question of
whether someone unsophisticated could have helped even more). What neither
group can do is point to clear evidence that what they do works.

Compare them to the chess grandmaster. If you try to tell the chess
grandmaster that he's no better than a random college professor, he can easily
play a professor and prove you wrong. Every time he plays, he's confronted
with inarguable evidence of success or failure. But therapists can often feel
like they're helping -- they just led their client to a breakthrough about
their childhood -- when they're actually not making any difference.

Synthesizing hundreds of these studies, K. Anders Ericsson concluded that what
distinguishes experts from non-experts is engaging in what he calls
_deliberate practice_.5 Mere practice isn't enough -- you can sit and make
predictions all day without getting any better at it -- it needs to be a kind
of practice where you receive "immediate informative feedback and knowledge of
results."6

In chess, for example, you pretty quickly discover whether you made a smart
move or a disastrous error, and it's even more obvious in other sports (when
practicing free-throws, it's pretty obvious if the ball misses the net). As a
result, chess players can try different tactics and learn which ones work and
which don't. Our pundit is not so lucky. Predicting a wave of revolutions in
the next twenty years can feel very exciting at the time, but it will be
twenty years before you learn whether it was a good idea or not. It's hard to
get much deliberate practice on that kind of time frame.

* * *

I've noticed very ambitious people often fall into this sort of trap. Any old
slob can predict what will happen tomorrow, they think, but I want to be truly
great, so I will pick a much harder challenge: I will predict what will happen
_in a hundred years_. It comes in lots of forms: instead of building another
silly site like Instagram, I will build an _artificial intelligence_; instead
of just doing another boring experiment, I will write _a grand work of social
theory_.

But being great isn't as easy as just picking a hard goal -- in fact, picking
a really hard goal avoids reality almost as much as picking a really easy one.
If you pick an easy goal, you know you'll always succeed (because it's so
easy); if you pick a really hard one, you know you'll never fail (because it
will always be too early to tell). Artificial intelligence is a truly big
problem -- how can you possibly expect us to succeed in just a decade? But
we're making great progress, we swear.

The trick is to set yourself lots of small challenges along the way. If your
startup is eventually going to make a million dollars, can it start by making
ten? If your book is going to eventually persuade the world, can you start by
persuading your friends? Instead of pushing all your tests for success way off
to the indefinite future, see if you can pass a very small one right now.

And it's important that you test for the right thing. If you're writing a
program that's supposed to make people's lives easier, what's important is not
whether they like your mockups in focus groups; it's whether you can make a
prototype that actually improves their lives.

* * *

One of the biggest problems in writing self-help books is getting people to
actually take your advice. It's not easy to tell a compelling story that
changes the way people view their problems, but it turns out to be a lot
easier than writing something that will actually persuade someone to get up
off the couch and change the way they live their life. There are some things
writing is really good at, but forcing people to get up and do something isn't
one of them.

The irony, of course, is that the books are totally useless unless you take
their advice. If you just keep reading them, thinking "that's so insightful!
that changes everything," but never actually doing anything different, then
pretty quickly the feeling will wear off and you'll start searching for
another book to fill the void. Chris Macleod calls this "epiphany addiction":
"Each time they feel like they've stumbled on some life changing discovery,
feel energized for a bit without going on to achieve any real world changes,
and then return to their default of feeling lonely and unsatisfied with their
life. They always end up back at the drawing board of trying to think their
way out of their problem, and it's not long before they come up with the
latest pseudo earth shattering insight."7

Don't let that happen to you. Go out and test yourself today: pick a task just
hard enough that you _might_ fail, and try to succeed at it. Reality is
painful -- it's so much easier to keep doing stuff you know you're good at or
else to pick something so hard there's no point at which it's obvious you're
failing -- but it's impossible to get better without confronting it.

## [Lean into the pain](dalio)

_This post is part four of the series [Raw Nerve](rawnerve)._

When you first begin to exercise, it's somewhat painful. Not wildly painful,
like touching a hot stove, but enough that if your only goal was to avoid
pain, you certainly would stop doing it. But if you keep exercising… well, it
just keeps getting more painful. When you're done, if you've really pushed
yourself, you often feel exhausted and sore. And the next morning it's even
worse.

If that was all that happened, you'd probably never do it. It's not that much
fun being sore. Yet we do it anyway -- because we know that, in the long run,
the pain will make us stronger. Next time we'll be able to run harder and lift
more before the pain starts.

And knowing this makes all the difference. Indeed, we come to see the pain as
a sort of pleasure -- it feels good to really push yourself, to fight through
the pain and make yourself stronger. Feel the burn! It's fun to wake up sore
the next morning, because you know that's just a sign that you're getting
stronger.

Few people realize it, but psychological pain works the same way. Most people
treat psychological pain like the hot stove -- if starting to think about
something scares them or stresses them out, they quickly stop thinking about
it and change the subject.

The problem is that the topics that are most painful also tend to be the
topics that are most important for us: they're the projects we most want to
do, the relationships we care most about, the decisions that have the biggest
consequences for our future, the most dangerous risks that we run. We're
scared of them because we know the stakes are so high. But if we never think
about them, then we can never do anything about them.

Ray Dalio writes:

> It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one's
limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength--whether it's in the form
of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way. Nature gave
us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we
have exceeded, our limits in some way. At the same time, nature made the
process of getting stronger require us to push our limits. Gaining strength is
the adaptation process of the body and the mind to encountering one's limits,
which is painful. In other words, both pain and strength typically result from
encountering one's barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important
juncture in our decision-making process.1

Yes it's painful, but the trick is to make that mental shift. To realize that
the pain isn't something awful to be postponed and avoided, but a signal that
you're getting stronger -- something to savor and enjoy. It's what makes you
better.

Pretty soon, when you start noticing something that causes you psychic pain,
you'll get excited about it, not afraid. _Ooh, another chance to get
stronger._ You'll seek out things you're scared of and intentionally confront
them, because it's an easy way to get the great rewards of self-improvement.
Dalio suggests thinking of each one as a puzzle, inside of which is embedded a
beautiful gem. If you fight through the pain to solve the puzzle, you unlock
it and get to keep the gem.

The trick is: when you start feeling that psychological pain coming on, don't
draw back from it and cower -- lean into it. Lean into the pain.

* * *

In agile software development, there's a phrase: If it hurts, do it more
often.2

For example, imagine Jane and Joan are working on a software project together.
They both have a copy of the code; Jane is making the error messages
friendlier while Joan is adding a new feature. They both work on their task
for days and days until it's finally done. Now they face a problem: they need
to _merge_ their different changes back together.

Maybe you've had this problem, either with code or with text documents: you
send a draft of a report to two friends, both suggest different changes, and
you have to merge all their changes back into the original document. It's
incredibly annoying -- and doing it with software is way worse. So people put
it off. Jane thinks "you know, let me just make the thank you messages a
little nicer before we merge" and Joan thinks "you know, let me add just one
more feature before we merge".

They keep putting the merge off, and every time they do the task gets bigger
and more painful. But they have to do it eventually. By then, the merge is so
big that it takes days of painstaking work just to piece together the already-
written code. It's an arduous, painful process -- which makes Joan and Jane
just want to put it off even longer next time.

The agile approach, however, is to do the opposite: merging hurts, so we'll do
it more often. Instead of merging every couple weeks, or every couple months,
we'll merge every single day, or every couple hours. Even if Jane and Joan
aren't even close to finished with their work, they'll check in what they have
so far (maybe with some special code deactivating it until it's finished) so
they don't end up in merge hell later on. These very small merges tend not to
be painful at all, they're so easy that you hardly even notice.

The same principle shows up all across software development: from testing to
releasing, your natural inclination is to put off painful things, when doing
them more often actually is much easier.

And I don't think it's limited to software. I think the same principle would
work even if, for some odd reason, you were required to touch a hot stove for
an hour. Procrastinating and putting it off until you had no choice but to
hold your hand to the stove for a full hour would end up being very painful.
But if you did it in small frequent bits, just quick taps of the stove with
your finger that eventually added up to an hour, it wouldn't be so bad at all.
Again, the trick is not to run from the pain.

* * *

Of all the self-improvement tricks I've learned, this one was by far the most
surprising -- and by far the most impactful. I spent most of my life hemmed in
by my talents. I knew I had strengths and weaknesses and it just seemed
obvious I should find jobs that fit my strengths. It seemed crazy to take a
job that probed my weaknesses.

Sure, there were somethings, over there, that I wished I was better at, but
they seemed so far away. Meanwhile, there were lots of things over here that I
was good at. Why not just keep doing them? Sure, I realized intellectually
that [I could get better](dweck) at the other stuff, but it hardly seemed
worth the pain of trying.

I'd learned [not to shrink from hard truths](semmelweis), so I'd literally
have this conversation with myself: "Yes, I know: if I got better at selling
things to people [or whatever it was], I'd be much better off. But look at how
painful I find selling: just thinking about it makes me want to run and hide!
Sure, it'd be great if I could do it, but is it really worth all that pain?"

Now I realize this is a bogus argument: it's not that the pain is so bad that
it makes me flee, it's that the importance of the topic triggers a fight-or-
flight reaction deep in my reptile brain. If instead of thinking of it as a
scary subject to avoid, I think of it as an exciting opportunity to get
better, then it's no longer a cost-benefit tradeoff at all: both sides are a
benefit -- I get the benefits of being good at selling and the fun of getting
better at something.

Do this enough times and your whole outlook on life begins to change. It's no
longer a scary world, hemming you in, but an exciting one full of exciting
adventures to pursue.3

Tackling something big like this is terrifying; it's far too much to start
with. It's always better to start small. What's something you've been avoiding
thinking about? It can be anything -- a relationship difficulty, a problem at
work, something on your todo list you've been avoiding. Call it to mind --
despite the pain it brings -- and just sort of let it sit there. Acknowledge
that thinking about it is painful and feel good about yourself for being able
to do it anyway. Feel it becoming less painful as you force yourself to keep
thinking about it. See, you're getting stronger!

OK, take a break. But when you're ready, come back to it, and start thinking
of concrete things you can do about it. See how it's not as scary as you
thought? See how good it feels to actually do something about it?

Next time you start feeling that feeling, that sense of pain from deep in your
head that tells you to avoid a subject -- ignore it. Lean into the pain
instead. You'll be glad you did.

## [What are the optimal biases to overcome?](optimalbias)

_This is a bonus post for my series [Raw
Nerve](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve). It originally appeared in
[somewhat different
form](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dya/what_are_the_optimal_biases_to_overcome/) on
Less Wrong._

I've noticed that some people have complimented my series [Raw
Nerve](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve) by saying it's a great
explanation of cognitive biases. Which always amuses me, since the series grew
out of frustrations I had with the usual way that term gets used. There's a
group of people (call them the cognitive bias community) who say the way to be
more rational -- to get better at making decisions that get you what you want
-- is to work at overcoming your biases. But if you're overcoming biases,
surely there are some lessons that will help you more than others.

You might start with the most famous ones, which tend to be the ones
popularized by Kahneman and Tversky. But K&T were academics. They weren't
trying to help people be more rational, they were trying to prove to other
academics that people were irrational. The result is that they focused not on
the most important biases, but the ones that were easiest to prove.

Take their famous anchoring experiment, in which they showed the spin of a
roulette wheel affected people's estimates about African countries. The idea
wasn't that roulette wheels causing biased estimates was a huge social
problem; it was that no academic could possibly argue that this behavior was
somehow rational. They thereby scored a decisive blow for psychology against
economists claiming we're just rational maximizers.

Most academic work on irrationality has followed in K&T's footsteps. And, in
turn, much of the stuff done by the wider cognitive bias community has
followed in the footsteps of this academic work. So it's not hard to believe
that cognitive bias types are good at avoiding these biases and thus do well
on the psychology tests for them. (Indeed, many of the questions on these
tests for rationality come straight from K&T experiments!)

But if you look at the average person and ask why they aren't getting what
they want, very rarely do you conclude their biggest problem is that they're
suffering from anchoring, framing effects, the planning fallacy, commitment
bias, or any of the other stuff in these tests. Usually their biggest problems
are far more quotidian and commonsensical, like procrastination and fear.

One of the things that struck me was watching Eliezer Yudkowsky, one of the
most impressive writers on the topic of cognitive biases, try to start a new
nonprofit. For years, the organization he founded struggled until recently,
when Luke Muehlhauser was named executive director. Eliezer readily agrees
that Luke has done more to achieve Eliezer's own goals for the organization
than Eliezer ever did.

But why? Why is Luke so much better at getting what Eliezer wants than Eliezer
is? It's surely not because Luke is so much better at avoiding the standard
cognitive biases! Luke often talks about how he's constantly learning new
rationality techniques from Eliezer.

No, it's because Luke did what seems like common sense: he bought a copy of
_Nonprofits for Dummies_ and did what it recommends. As Luke himself [says](ht
tp://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/6klg?contex
t=1#6l4h), it wasn't lack of intelligence or resources or willpower that kept
Eliezer from doing these things, "it was a gap in general rationality."

So if you're interested in closing the gap, it seems like the skills to
prioritize aren't things like commitment effect and the sunk cost fallacy, but
stuff like "figure out what your goals really are", "look at your situation
objectively and list the biggest problems", "when you're trying something new
and risky, read the For Dummies book about it first", etc. That's the stuff
I'm interested in writing about.

## [Look at yourself objectively](semmelweis)

_This post is part three of the series [Raw Nerve](rawnerve)._

In the 1840s, hospitals were dangerous places. Mothers who went in to give
birth often didn't make it out. For example, at Vienna General Hospital's
First Obstetrical Clinic, as many as 10% of mothers died of puerperal fever
after giving birth. But there was some good news: at the Second Clinic, the
number was just 4%. Expectant mothers noticed this -- some would get down on
their knees and beg to be admitted to the Second Clinic. Others, hearing new
patients were being admitted to the First Clinic that day, decided they'd
rather give birth in the streets.

Ignaz Semmelweis, an assistant at the First Clinic, couldn't bear it. He began
desperately searching for some kind of explanation for the difference. He
tested many things without success. Then, in 1847, Semmelweis's friend Jakob
Kolletschka was performing an autopsy when a student accidentally poked him
with a scalpel. It was a minor injury, but Kolletschka got terribly sick and
ultimately passed away, with symptoms rather like the what the mothers had.
Which got Semmelweis wondering: was some "deathly material" on the corpses
responsible for the deaths?

To test this, he insisted the doctors begin washing their hands with
chlorinated lime (which he found best removed the stink of death) before
handling the pregnant women. The results were shocking. In April 1847, the
mortality rate was 18.3%. Semmelweis instituted handwashing in mid-May and by
June the mortality rate had crashed to 2.2%. The next month it was even less
and later that year it reached zero -- for the first time ever.

You'd think doctors would be thrilled by this incredible discovery. Instead,
Semmelweis was ridiculed and attacked. He was fired from the hospital and
forced out of Vienna. "In published medical works my teachings are either
ignored or attacked," he complained. "The medical faculty at Würzburg awarded
a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected."
Even in his native Vienna, hundreds of mothers continued to die every year.

Semmelweis turned to alcohol and his behavior became increasingly erratic. In
1865, he was committed to a mental institution. There he was beaten by the
guards, placed in a straitjacket, and locked in a dark cell. He died shortly
thereafter, at the age of 47, from an infected wound.1

* * *

Why did doctors so stubbornly reject Ignaz Semmelweis? Well, imagine being
told _you_ were responsible for the deaths of thousands of your patients. That
you had been killing the people you were supposed to be protecting. That you
were so bad at your job that you were actually worse than just giving birth in
the street.

We all know people don't like to hear bad news about themselves. Indeed, we go
out of our way to avoid it -- and when we do confront it, we try to downplay
it or explain it away. Cognitive dissonance psychologists have proven it in
dozens of experiments: Force students through an embarrassing initiation to
take a class, and they'll insist the class is much more interesting. Make them
do a favor for someone they hate, and they start insisting they actually like
them. Have them make a small ethical compromises and they'll feel comfortable
making bigger and bigger ones. Instead of just accepting we made a mistake,
and shouldn't have compromised or done the favor or join the class, we start
telling ourselves that compromising isn't so bad -- and when the next
compromise comes along, we believe the lies we tell ourselves, and leap at
making another mistake. We hate hearing bad news about ourselves so much that
we'd rather _change our behavior_ than just admit we screwed up.2

It doesn't help much when our friends point out what we did wrong. If we're so
scared of hearing from ourselves that we made a mistake, just imagine how much
we hate hearing it from someone else. And our friends know this: the answer to
"Does this outfit make me look fat?" is not supposed to be "yes." We may joke
about our friends' foibles behind their back, but we rarely do so to their
face. Even at work, a lot of effort goes into making sure employees are
insulated from their superior's most negative assessments. This is what we're
taught: make five compliments for every criticism, sandwich negative feedback
with positive feedback on each side, the most important thing is to keep up
someone's self-esteem.

But, as Semmelweis showed, this is a dangerous habit. Sure, it's awful to hear
you're killing people--but it's way worse to _keep on killing people_! It may
not be fun to get told you're lazy, but it's better to hear it now than to
find out when you're fired. If you want to work on getting better, you need to
start by knowing where you are.

* * *

Semmelweis was defeated about as much as a man can be defeated. But nothing
the other doctors could do to him would change the facts. Eventually
scientists proved the germ theory of disease and Semmelweis was vindicated.
Today, he's an international hero: universities and hospitals are named after
him, his house has been turned into a museum, Austria even put his face on a
€50 gold coin. Meanwhile, the doctors who opposed him are now seen as close-
minded killers.

Try as you might, you can't beat reality. Semmelweis was right: those doctors
_were_ killing people. Firing him, driving him out of the country, writing
long books disproving all his claims -- none of it could change that
frightening fact. The doctors may have thought they were winning the argument
at the time, but they were big losers in the long run. And so were all the
families that lost a loved one because they refused to admit their mistake.

But imagine if they had. When you're being attacked, conceding you screwed up
seems like the worst thing you can do. If even you won't stand up for
yourself, how can anyone else believe in you? Admitting your mistakes seems
like giving up; it just proves that your opponents were right all along. But
is it really so bad?

When Oprah started defending fabulist James Frey, she was savaged by the
press. So she invited her critics on the show and apologized, saying "You were
right, I was wrong." It didn't destroy her reputation; it rescued it. When the
space shuttle _Columbia_ exploded, launch manager Wayne Hale took full
responsibility: "The bottom line is that I failed to understand what I was
being told…I am guilty of allowing Columbia to crash." He was promoted. When
JFK admitted the responsibility for the Bay of Pigs fiasco was "mine, and mine
alone," his poll numbers soared.3

Imagine the same thing in your own life. If your boss started taking
responsibility for your organization's problems instead of blaming others,
wouldn't you like him more? If your doctor told you honestly that she had
screwed up a procedure, instead of trying to cover up the mistake, wouldn't
you prefer that? If a politician came clean that their policy proposals had
failed, wouldn't you be more likely to trust him?

In moments of great emotional stress, we revert to our worst habits: we dig in
and fight harder. The real trick is not to get better at fighting -- it's to
get better at stopping ourselves: at taking a deep breath, calming down, and
letting our better natures take over from our worst instincts.

* * *

Even if seeing ourselves objectively is the best option, all our natural
instincts all point the other direction. Not only do we try hard to avoid bad
news about ourselves, we tend to exaggerate the good news. Imagine you and
Jane are both up for a promotion. You want it bad, so you stay late, you work
weekends. Sure, some things still slip through the cracks -- but even those
mistakes have really good reasons! Jane never does anything like that.

But if she did -- would you even know? We see the world from our own
perspective. When we have to cancel hanging out with friends to do extra work,
we always see that -- and feel the sacrifice. But when Jane does it, we see
and feel nothing. You only get to see your own perspective. And even our
mistakes make sense from our perspective -- we see all of the context,
everything that led up to it. It all makes sense because we saw it happen.
When we screw up, it's for a reason. When other people screw up, it's because
they're screwups.

* * *

Looking at ourselves objectively isn't easy. But it's essential if we ever
want to get better. And if we don't do it, we leave ourselves open to con
artists and ethical compromisers who prey on our desire to believe we're
perfect. There's no one solution, but here are some tricks I use to get a more
accurate sense of myself:

_Embrace your failings._ Be willing to believe the worst about yourself.
Remember: it's much better to accept that you're a selfish, racist moron and
try to improve, than to continue sleepwalking through life that way as the
only one who doesn't know it.

_Studiously avoid euphemism._ People try and sugarcoat the tough facts about
themselves by putting them in the best light possible. They say "Well, I was
going to get to it, but then there was that big news story today" and not
"Yeah, I was procrastinating on it and started reading the news instead."
Stating things plainly makes it easier to confront the truth.

_Reverse your projections._ Every time you see yourself complaining about
other groups or other people, stop yourself and think: "is it possible, is
there any way, that someone out there might be making the same complaints
about me?"

_Look up, not down._ It's always easy to make yourself look good by finding
people even worse than you. Yes, we agree, you're not the worst person in the
world. That's not the question. The question is whether you can get better --
and to do that you need to look at the people who are even better than you.

_Criticize yourself._ The main reason people don't tell you what they really
think of you is they're afraid of your reaction. (If they're right to be
afraid, then you need to start by working on that.) But people will feel more
comfortable telling you the truth if you start by criticizing yourself,
showing them that it's OK.

_Find honest friends._ There are some people who are just congenitally honest.
For others, it's possible to build a relationship of honesty over time. Either
way, it's important to find friends who you can trust to tell to tell you the
harsh truths about yourself. _This is really hard_ -- most people don't like
telling harsh truths. Some people have had success providing an anonymous
feedback form for people to submit their candid reactions.

_Listen to the criticism._ Since it's so rare to find friends who will
honestly criticize you, you need to listen extra-carefully when they do. It's
tempting to check what they say against your other friends. For example, if
one friend says the short story you wrote isn't very good, you might show it
to some other friends and ask them what they think. Wow, they all think it's
great! Guess that one friend was just an outlier. But the fact is that most of
your friends are going to say it's great because they're your friend; by just
taking their word for it, you end up ignoring the one person who's actually
being honest with you.

_Take the outside view._ As I said before, we're always locked in our own
heads, where everything we do makes sense. So try seeing what you look like
from the outside for a bit, assuming you don't know any of those details.
Sure, your big money-making plan sounds like a great idea when you explain it,
but if you throw that away, is there any external evidence that it will work?

## [What Happens in _Batman Begins_](batmanbegins)

_Warning: Naturally, spoilers follow -- for both_ Batman Begins _and_ The Dark
Knight Rises.1

We begin in the 1980s, when the global forces of evil have decided to
institute a new economic policy on the world. Their nefarious plan
dramatically exacerbates inequality, making the rich filthy rich while the
poor suffer terrible levels of unemployment.

The difference is that in the Batman universe, Gotham's leading billionaire
(Thomas Wayne) can't stand the suffering and begins investing in the city when
the government won't. He builds a giant Keynesian supertrain in a desperate
attempt to get the city back to work. But, in an ironic twist, he ends up
murdered by one of the desperate poverty-stricken citizens he's trying so hard
to help.

The murder of the billionaire shocks the surviving billionaires, leading them
to reverse their neoliberal policies. Instead of getting tough on crime, they
decide to indulge criminals, with a deep willingness to treat criminality as
merely a mental health problem.

As the billionaires retreat from power, organized crime steps in, taking their
place in buying off judges and unions and cops. Instead of being run by Wayne
Enterprises, the city ends up being run by mob boss Carmine Falcone.

But a few rogue elements in the police and DA's office refuse to be bought
off. They free the man who murdered Thomas Wayne in exchange for his testimony
against Falcone. Bruce Wayne, the billionaire's son, is so haunted by his
personal demons that he can't stand this trade-off. When his childhood-friend-
turned-rogue-ADA points out the selfishness of his position, he confronts
Falcone. When Falcone explains that Bruce will always live in fear of what he
does not understand, Bruce sets off on a quest to understand criminals.

His search concludes in a far eastern terrorist training camp, which turns out
to be backed by the same global forces of evil that invented neoliberalism.
It's the year 2000 and they have a new plan: attacking Gotham with the hope of
inspiring enough fear that the city will destroy itself.2

Bruce, still haunted by the execution of his parents, refuses to become an
executioner himself and, instead of joining the plot, sets fire to the camp
before returning to clean up Gotham his own way. He begins by putting together
a case against Falcone and re-seizing control of Wayne Enterprises by buying
up its shares on the public market.

In doing so, he begins a reversal of history that eventually culminates in
[_The Dark Knight Rises_](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdkr). His attack on
Falcone leads to a new era of tough-on-crime, which dethrones the organized
criminals and allows the wealthy to seize power again. The wealthy quickly
reinstitute neoliberalism and buy back Bruce's shares on the public market,
putting Wayne Enterprises back in their hands. But the global forces of evil
step in once again to "restore balance" by letting Bane to release the
organized criminals.3 Bruce Wayne goes back to being an innocent child of
privilege and the trilogy ends exactly where it started.4

* * *

  1. _Batman Begins_ is very clearly the mirror image of [_The Dark Knight Rises_](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdkr) (some scenes are almost word-for-word the same), so understanding one can help us understand the other. ↩

  2. Yes, in this trilogy 9/11 really was an inside job, from the same folks who brought you Reaganomics. ↩

  3. Democrats, Republicans, organized crime, or billionaire financiers -- whoever tries to seize power, the global forces of evil continue to hold the reins from behind-the-scenes, making sure nobody changes the system too much. ↩

  4. Exactly, right down to how Robin (who see as a small boy in the first film, the same way we see Bruce in flashbacks) ends the film frustrated by the system (the same way Bruce was frustrated by Rachel) and is about to head out in a quest of his own, following the same path Bruce Wayne took. Thus the cycle continues. ↩

## [Believe you can change](dweck)

_This post is part two of the series [Raw Nerve](rawnerve)._

Carol Dweck was obsessed with failure. You know how some people just seem to
succeed at everything they do, while others seem helpless, doomed to a life of
constant failure? Dweck noticed that too -- and she was determined to figure
out why. So she began watching kids, trying to see if she could spot the
difference between the two groups.

In a 1978 study with Carol Diener, she gave kids various puzzles and recorded
what they said as they tried to solve them. Very quickly, the helpless kids
started blaming themselves: "I'm getting confused," one said; "I never did
have a good rememory," another explained.

But the puzzles kept coming -- and they kept getting harder. "This isn't fun
anymore," the kids cried. But still, there were more puzzles.

The kids couldn't take it anymore. "I give up," they insisted. They started
talking about other things, trying to take their mind off the onslaught of
tricky puzzles. "There is a talent show this weekend, and I am going to be
Shirley Temple," one girl said. Dweck just gave them even harder puzzles.

Now the kids started getting silly, almost as if they could hide their failure
by making it clear they weren't trying in the first place. Despite repeatedly
being told it was incorrect, one boy just kept choosing brown as his answer,
saying "Chocolate cake, chocolate cake."1

Maybe these results aren't surprising. If you've ever tried to play a board
game with kids, you've probably seen them say all these things and more (Dweck
appears to be missing the part where they pick up the game board and throw all
the pieces on the floor, then run away screaming).

But what shocked her -- and changed the course of her career -- was the
behavior of the successful kids. "Everyone has a role model, someone who
pointed the way at a critical moment in their lives," she later wrote. "These
children were my role models. They obviously knew something I didn't and I was
determined to figure it out."2

Dweck, like many adults, had learned to hide her frustration and anger, to
politely say "I'm not sure I want to play this anymore" instead of knocking
over the board. She figured the successful kids would be the same -- they'd
have tactics for coping with failure instead of getting beaten down by it.

But what she found was radically different. The successful kids didn't just
live with failure, they _loved_ it! When the going got tough, they didn't
start blaming themselves; they licked their lips and said "I love a
challenge." They'd say stuff like "The harder it gets the harder I need to
try."

Instead of complaining it wasn't fun when the puzzles got harder, they'd psych
themselves up, saying "I've almost got it now" or "I did it before, I can do
it again." One kid, upon being a given a really hard puzzle, one that was
supposed to be obviously impossible to solve, just looked up at the
experimenter with a smile and said, "You know, I was _hoping_ this would be
informative."3

_What was wrong with them?_

* * *

The difference, Dweck discovered, was one of mindset. Dweck had always thought
"human qualities were carved in stone. You were smart or you weren't, and
failure meant you weren't." That was why the helpless kids couldn't take it
when they started failing. It just reminded them they sucked (they easily got
confused, they had "a bad rememory"). Of course it wasn't fun anymore -- why
would it be fun to get constantly reminded you're a failure? No wonder they
tried to change the subject. Dweck called this the "fixed mindset" -- the
belief that your abilities are fixed and that the world is just a series of
tests that show you how good you are.

The successful kids believed precisely the opposite: that everything came
through effort and that the world was full of interesting challenges that
could help you learn and grow. (Dweck called this the "growth mindset.")
That's why they were so thrilled by the harder puzzles -- the easier ones
weren't any sort of challenge, there was nothing you could learn from them.
But the really tough ones? Those were fascinating -- a new skill to develop, a
new problem to conquer. In later experiments, kids even asked to take puzzles
home so they could work on them some more.4

It took a seventh-grader to explain it to her: "I think intelligence is
something you have to work for…it isn't just given to you… Most kids, if
they're not sure of an answer, will not raise their hand… But what I usually
do is raise my hand, because if I'm wrong, then my mistake will be corrected.
Or I will raise my hand and say… 'I don't get this. Can you help me?' Just by
doing that I'm increasing my intelligence."5

In the fixed mindset, success comes from proving how great you are. Effort is
a bad thing -- if you have to try hard and ask questions, you obviously can't
be very good. When you find something you _can_ do well, you want to do it
over and over, to show how good you are at it.

In the growth mindset, success comes from growing. Effort is what it's all
about -- it's what makes you grow. When you get good at something, you put it
aside and look for something harder so that you can keep growing.

Fixed-mindset people feel smart when they don't make mistakes, growth-mindset
people feel smart when they struggle with something for a long time and then
finally figure it out. Fixies try to blame the world when things go bad,
growthers look to see what they can change about themselves. Fixies are afraid
to try hard -- because if they fail, it means they're a failure. Growthers are
afraid of not trying.

* * *

As Dweck continued her research, she kept finding this difference in all sorts
of places. In relationships, growth-mindset people looked for partners who
would push them to be better, fixies just wanted someone who would put them on
a pedestal (and got into terrible fights when they hit problems). Growther
CEOs keep looking for new products and ways to improve, fixies cut research
and tried to squeeze profits from old successes. Even in sports, growther
athletes got better and better through constant practice, while fixies blamed
their atrophying skills on everyone around them.

But Dweck applied a growth mindset to the question of mindset -- and
discovered that your mindset could itself be changed. Even small interventions
-- like telling students they were doing well because they tried hard, rather
than because they were smart -- had huge effects. With more work, she could
change totally fixed-mindset people into fervent growth-mindset ones.

She herself changed, converting from a fervent fixed-mindsetter, always
looking for excuses to prove how smart she was, to a growther, looking for new
challenges. It was hard: "since I was taking more risks, I might look back
over the day and see all the mistakes and setbacks. And feel miserable. [You
feel like a zero]… you want to rush right out and rack up some high numbers."
But she resisted the urge -- and became a leading psychologist instead.6

* * *

The first step to getting better is believing you _can_ get better. In her
book, _[Mindset](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0345472322)_, Dweck explains how
to start talking back to your fixed mindset. The fixed mindset says, "What if
you fail? You'll be a failure." The growth mindset replies, "Most successful
people had failures along the way."7

Now when I first heard about this work, I just thought: that's nice, but I
already do all this. I believe fervently that intelligence can change and that
talents can be learned. Indeed, I'd say I'm almost pathologically growth
mindset. But even I began to notice there are some things I have a fixed
mindset about.

For example, I used to think I was introverted. Everyone had always told me
that you were either an extroverted person or an introverted person. From a
young age, I was quite shy and bookish, so it seemed obvious: I was an
introvert.

But as I've grown, I've found that's hardly the end of the story. I've started
to get good at leading a conversation or cracking people up with a joke. I
_like_ telling stories at a party a story or buzzing about a room saying 'hi'
to people. I get a rush from it! Sure, I'm still not the most party-oriented
person I know, but I no longer think we fit into any neat
introversion/extroversion buckets.

Growth mindset has become a kind of safe word for my partner and I. Whenever
we feel the other person getting defensive or refusing to try something
because "I'm not any good at it", we say "Growth mindset!" and try to approach
the problem as a chance to grow, rather than a test of our abilities. It's no
longer scary, it's just another project to work on.

Just like life itself.

## [Edmund Burke Explains _The Dark Knight Rises_](burketdkr)

From Corey Robin's fantastic book _[The Reactionary
Mind](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0199793743)_:

> Great power, [Burke] suggests in _The Sublime and the Beautiful_, should
never aspire to be--and can never actually be--beautiful. What great power
needs is sublimity. The sublime is the sensation we experience in the face of
extreme pain, danger, or terror. It is something like awe but tinged with fear
and dread. Burke calls it "delightful horror." Great power should aspire to
sublimity rather than beauty because sublimity produces "the strongest emotion
which the mind is capable of feeling." It is an arresting yet invigorating
emotion, which has the simultaneous but contradictory effect of diminishing
and magnifying us. We feel annihiliated by great power; at the same time, our
sense of self "swell[s]" when "we are conversant with terrible objects." Great
power achieves sublimity when it is, among other things, obscure and
mysterious, and when it is extreme. "In all things," writes Burke, the sublime
"abhors mediocrity."1

>

> In the _Reflections_, Burke suggests that the problem in France is that the
old regime is beautiful while the revolution is sublime. The landed interest,
the cornerstone of the old regime, is "sluggish, inert, and timid." It cannot
defend itself "from the invasions of ability," with ability standing in here
for the new men of power that the revolution brings forth. Elsewhere in the
_Reflections_, Burke says that the moneyed interest, which is allied with the
revolution, is stronger than the aristocratic interest because it is "more
ready for any adventure" and "more disposed to new enterprises of any kind."
The old regime, in other words, is beautiful, static, and weak; the revolution
is ugly, dynamic, and strong. And in the horrors that the revolution
perpetrates--the rabble rushing into the bedchamber of the queen, dragging her
half-naked into the street, and marching her and her family to Paris--the
revolution achieves a kind of sublimity: "We are alarmed into reflexion,"
writes Burke of the revolutionaries' actions. "Our minds … are purified by
terror and pity; our weak unthinking pride is humbled, under the dispensations
of a mysterious wisdom.2

>

> Beyond these simple professions of envy or admiration, the conservative
actually copies and learns from the revolution he opposes. "To destroy that
enemy," Burke wrote of the Jacobins, "by some means or other, the force
opposed to it should be made to bear some analogy and resemblance to the force
and spirit which that system exerts."3

Is it not all here, right down to the moneyed interests allying with the
revolution and the revolution throwing the aristocrats from their bedchambers?

## [Take a step back](stepback)

_This post introduces a new series, [Raw Nerve](rawnerve)._

For most of my life, I saw my job as just making good choices. I was the
decider, tasked with making the best selection from the options life
presented. I could play with this friend or that one, go to this college or
that one, take this job offer or the other one.

Even my problems I dealt with this way. If someone was annoying me, I'd choose
to avoid them. If something was bugging me, I'd choose to stop thinking about
it. I mostly kept my eyes on what was in front of me.

But recently I've started appreciating the virtues of stepping back and trying
to see the bigger picture. Instead of just picking the best option, I try to
invent new ones. Instead of just avoiding the stuff that bugs me, should I
start making plans to fix them.

It's given me a weird feeling. I feel more in control of my life, more able to
cope with my problems. I feel like I'm charting my own destiny, instead of
following some track. It's hard to explain, but it's a feeling like I'm
getting stronger -- not physically, but psychologically. It's a good feeling.
I feel like I'm growing as a person.

So I started wondering: _Is there more where that came from?_ I realized I've
never stopped to ask whether I could get better at life. After all, in my day
job, I'm constantly looking for ways to learn and grow -- reading the latest
books and articles about the field, talking to other people with similar jobs
and hearing what's worked for them. Why aren't I doing the same thing for
life?

It turns out to be surprisingly hard. Life comes with no instruction manual
and the advice parents give is all over the place. TV and the newspapers don't
offer much more than narrow Quick Tips and I never saw a course in this stuff
at school. There are self-help books and self-improvement courses, of course,
but they seem overly practical: they're usually less about working through
tough problems and more about energizing you to Get Up And Go! And there's
philosophy about The Good Life, but it seems to go too far in the other
direction: there's very little in there for someone to practically apply.

The blogs are a weird mix. There are the blogs on "life hacks," which are full
of gadgets and gizmos that seem to cause more problems than they solve. There
are the anti-procrastination blogs, where the author has a constant stream of
epiphanies that all seem to amount to "just put away the distractions and get
stuff done." And there are the charlatans, who tell you that all your wildest
dreams can come true if you just follow their patented advice.

So instead of an obvious place to go, I've just been finding little bits and
pieces in all sorts of strange places: psychology experiments, business books,
philosophy, self-help, math, and my friends. But since there's no community
around it, it's hard to discuss it with anyone (trying to persuade other
people to be interested in what you're interested in is a fool's game).

So I figure I'll just start writing about it here and see if anyone cares.
Maybe it'll grow into something, but even if it doesn't at least I'll clarify
my thoughts and hopefully get a few good suggestions for further reading.

I don't have a name for what I'm talking about or even a good sense of what it
is. I'm hopeful that will become clearer with practice. But in the meantime,
what's helped you get better at life?–at thinking, deciding, working,
thinking. Whether it's a gadget or technique or book or person, I'd love it if
you [posted what you've found most helpful in the
comments](http://talk.aaronsw.com/take-a-step-back).
