<h1>Seth David Schoen's Letter</h1>

<p>In the following famous picture (<a href="pictureOfLetterSethDavidSchoen">mirror</a>), <a href="http://loyalty.org/~schoen/">Seth David Schoen</a> is holding an envelope containing a letter he sent to the editor of Wired Magazize about shrinkwrap licenses. On the envelope, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE<br /> <strong>THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT</strong> between <br />you and the Electronic Frontier Foundation,<br /> 454 Shotwell Street, San Francisco, CA 94110.<br /> <strong>By opening this envelope,</strong> you agree to print<br /> the contents of the enclosed letter in Wired<br /> 9.11, or, at your option, any later magazine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wired apparently did not print his letter in 9.11, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.11/rants.html">at least in their online version</a>. But Seth really did himself in by saying "or, at your option, any later magazine" -- Wired could indefinitely delay printing his letter saying, they planned to put it in some later magazine. (This has an interesting similarity to <a href="http://eldred.cc/">the Eldred case</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> EFF lawyers are bad at being evil.</p>
