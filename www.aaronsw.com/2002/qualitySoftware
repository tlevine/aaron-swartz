  <h1>Quality Software</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Quality software is made by artists, not engineers or programmers. But software is unlike other fields of art, because it needs to be superbly functional in addition to aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>I have found that there are two types of quality software: GUI software and UNIX software. Quality GUI software is beautiful to look at, as well as a joy to use. Quality UNIX is beautiful to comprehend, as well as a joy to work with.</p>

<h2>GUI Software Artists</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/software/">Apple (Applications Team)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/">OmniGroup</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ranchero.com/software/">Ranchero</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While all of their products have some faults, these designers do some of the best work I've seen.</p>

<h2>UNIX Software Artists</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cr.yp.to/software.html">D. J. Bernstein</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Unquestionably the best UNIX software artist ever, his work repays careful study. Not only is it secure and amazingly functional, but it is also well-designed so that it feels like a masterpiece of art in addition to a piece of software.</p>

<p>I have noticed that those who like Professor Bernstein's software are quite often very intelligent. The inverse is not always true: while many people who don't like Bernstein's software are not particularly intelligent, some are merely misguided.</p>

<p>It is a continuing frustration to me that Professor Bernstein has no peer in software design. It would be great to have a culture of innovative quality UNIX software. Currently, it seems all quality UNIX software is, to some degree, emulation:</p>

<p>@@Other candidates: David McCusker, Rael Dornfest.</p>

<p>@@Scholars: me, Matt Webb, Mike Gancarz(?), guy who wrote bstj article, who else?</p>

<p>Eric S. Raymond is writing <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">a book on the Unix philosophy</a> but it looks like he's getting everything wrong.</p>

<p>I am interested in hearing about other quality software artists. <a href="mailto:qualitysoftware@aaronsw.com">Please send your suggestions</a>.</p>
