<h2>The Maya Calendar's Cycle Ends</h2>
<p>The Maya have a cyclical calendar. The world is said to have begun at the beginning of one of the larger cycles and it was prophesied that it would end at the end of one of the cycles. The cycle-switchovers were always spent by sacrificing so that the world would not end. (Sorta like Y2K...) The next cycle ends in 2012.</p>

<h2>Terrence McKenna</h2>

<p>McKenna did some calculations and found the world would end in 2012...</p>

<h2>Scientists</h2>

<p>There's a lot of talk about "scientists" calculating that things run out in 2012.</p>

<h2>Crop Circles</h2>

<p>Just read in Wired (2002-07) that the Crop Circles indicate takeover in Dec. 2012.</p>

<h2>Etc...</h2>

<p>Oops, can't finish this page now. Gotta run.</p>
