<p>It&#8217;s always cool to run into other smart young people. Maybe I can convince him to <a href="http://swartzfam.com/aaron/school/2001/04/05/">rise out</a> of the school system, like me.<p /><p />For those who don&#8217;t know, this is my first year out of the school system. Had I stayed, I would have been in 10th grade this year. I gotta say, it was a <a href="http://swartzfam.com/aaron/school/2001/06/03/">hard choice</a>, but I think it may have been the best choice I ever made. Now I&#8217;m <a href="http://swartzfam.com/aaron/school/2001/09/13/">taking a couple classes</a> at a local college. The next term starts on Wednesday. I&#8217;m taking &#8220;Number Theory&#8221; and &#8220;Symbolic Logic&#8221;, I think.</p>
