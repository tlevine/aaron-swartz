<p><em>&#8220;They say we can&#8217;t visualize total nothing. Hell, sit at any committee meeting!&#8221;</em> - Kent Lansing in The Fountainhead<p /><p />I spent all day reading The Fountainhead yesterday, almost non-stop. Took me until midnight. Surprisingly, I liked it. I still disagree with Rand and Objectivism, but I think the actions of the characters spoke stronger than Rand&#8217;s words.<p /><p />It&#8217;s a story of an architect, Howard Roark, on a crusade to create buildings of meaning, in a world of people who simply repeat the ideas fed to them by the media and their friends. It&#8217;s 1984 and Brave New World, except the enemy isn&#8217;t the State, it&#8217;s the Society. <p /><p /><a href="http://felter.org/wesley/">Wes</a>: calling <a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newJan02.htm#31jan02">David McCusker</a>! :-)<p /><p />By the end, there&#8217;s only one point I really disagree with: Rand says that creators should be selfish, and if people try to change their vision, then the creator has the right to stop those people. I can&#8217;t go along with that. Unlike many folks in California&#8217;s south, I don&#8217;t think that culture can be owned. Everyone gets to contribute to the pot, when when it&#8217;s all stirred up, our individual contributions amount to something greater than anyone could achieve completely alone.<p /><p /><a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>: <em>The Debian group encourages all authors not to restrict any files, source or binary, from being modified.</em></p>
