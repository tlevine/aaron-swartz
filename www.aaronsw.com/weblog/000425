<p>Since Hyatt loves <a href="http://www.blakeross.com/">Blake</a> so much, maybe he can get me a job at Apple. Or at least let me use his employee discount. I <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/">linked to your blog</a>, you owe me!</p>

<p>Food!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/2002_07_14_mozillian_archive.html#85252157">David Hyatt&#8217;s first day at Apple is hilairous.</a></p>

<p>Congrats to UserLand for getting Salon to blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theregus.com/content/6/25660.html">Sounds like they had a lot of fun at the DRM workshop the other day.</a> &#8220;Preston Padden, v.p. of public policy for Disney, who called for government intervention in DRM because he didn&#8217;t see all sides coming to an agreement without a push. Comer retorted that he doesn&#8217;t think Hollywood will end its fascination with sex and violence without government intervention, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m converting <a href="http://blogspace.com/">Blogspace</a> over to Apache on this server (<a href="http://vorpal.notabug.com/">vorpal</a>). Your DNS should be updated within 24 minutes. Please let me know if you see any breakage. (I&#8217;m still downloading the swhack stuff, so that will take a little longer.)</p>

<p>Weird archiving thought: run <code>gzip dir/ > dir/archive.tgz</code> every night (you&#8217;d get a directory with an archive of the directory with an archive of the previous directory with an archive &#8230;). I&#8217;m afraid I might have done this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.all-the-other-names-were-taken.com/tipstips.html">Rat out TIPS informants.</a> I was thinking of signing up to be a TIPS informant and supply information on the horrible things Ashcroft and Bush were doing to divide and terrorize the nation.</p>

<p>I proposed a Python Lightning Talk for OSCON:</p><blockquote>The Creative Commons project is trying to bring the same kind of less-restrictive-than-copyright licenses we see in software to other content while building a tagging system that allows licensed works to describe their license in a machine-readable form. Learn how to use a Python RDF API to parse this data so you can take advantage of it.</blockquote><p>I wonder if I can do that in five minutes. I need to find a simple Python RDF API, I guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Python plays a key role in our production pipeline. Without it a project the size of Star Wars: Episode II would have been very difficult to pull off. From crowd rendering to batch processing to compositing, Python binds all things together,&#8221; said Tommy Burnette, Senior Technical Director, <a href="http://www.ilm.com">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</a>.</p>

<p>Now all we need is a Python/Star Wars pun.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m converting <a href="http://logicerror.com/">LogicError</a> over to a static site on this server (<a href="http://vorpal.notabug.com/">vorpal</a>). Your DNS should be updated within 24 hours. Please let me know if you see any breakage.</p>

<p>Cryptome: <a href="http://cryptome.org/freetotravel.htm">Gilmore v. Ashcroft: Secret rule demanding &#8216;Your Papers Please&#8217; claimed unconstitutional</a>. <em>Gilmore rocks!</em> </p>

<p><a href="http://cryptome.org/gilmore-v-usa-cid.htm">The complaint</a> makes great reading. &#8220;On July 4, 2002, Plaintiff tried to fly to Washington, DC to petition the government for redress of grievances [specifically, the requirement for airline travelers to provide identification] and to associate with others for that purpose. He was stopped because he refused to identify himself before boarding the flight.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://cryptome.org/gilmore-v-usa-faq.htm">The FAQ</a> is good too. His argument sounds really strong.  &#8220;You can use free speech to say hurtful things. You can practice religions that make you cruel and intolerant.  You can commit a crime and then avoid torture that would make you confess. You can petition the government to build a police state run on Oracle servers.&#8221; &#8220;Government-imposed searches waste as much life <em>every year</em> as the lifetimes that the attack wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Where has <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/">John Gilmore&#8217;s website</a> gone? Did <a href="http://cryptome.org/verio-censorship.html">Verio succeed in censoring him</a>?</p>

<p>Python one-liners are fun: <code>ls | python -c "import sys, os<br />
for line in sys.stdin: line=line.strip(); os.rename(line, line+'.html')"</code></p>

<p><a href="http://www.eastgate.com/HypertextNow/archives/WeblogHandbook.html">Mark Bernstein reviews Rebecca Blood&#8217;s The Weblog Handbook:</a> &#8220;Romance assures us that, though weblogs fail everywhere, <em>our</em> weblog will prosper because we, ourselves, are wonderful. Rebecca Blood&#8217;s The Weblog Handbook is an inexorably romantic guide to building and cultivating a weblog.&#8221;</p>

<p>From his description of the book I find myself continously drawn in and repelled. I&#8217;d like to learn how to capture the spirit of my life in my writing but at the same time I choke on comments like &#8220;If you allow yourself to begin posting entries based on what you think someone else wants you to write, you are missing the point of having a weblog.&#8221; As for child-stalkers, I put my home phone number and address up on my website and (thankfully) I haven&#8217;t received one phone call yet. I&#8217;m not worried. I think that in Bernstein&#8217;s categorization, my view on weblogs (and life) is comedy (&#8220;our weblogs can succeed through hard work, struggle, and good fortune&#8221;).</p>

<p><a href="http://not.invisible.net/participate/individuals/not.store.html">IMS OPENCOOKIE FACT</a>: &#8216;While Brewster Kahle was still a student at MIT, he attended a lecture by Yvette entitled &#8220;ZweiBack: Crackers and Cookies for Posterity&#8221; which got the young computer scientist thinking. After he helped build the Thinking Machine and invented WAIS, Kahle returned to his true life&#8217;s work and opened The Internet Archive and his Wayback project.&#8217;</p>

<p>BTW, did you know that recipies have no copyright protection? I guess that makes every cookie an OpenCookie. And if people ask you how creative types can make money without copyright, just point them to Martha Stewart (or not).</p>

<p>May you move from strength to strength.</p>
