	<h1>A cure for nearsightedness?</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>I had some time to kill this morning so I decided to work on improving my eyesight. I sat down and tried focusing on some distant things. Affter an hour or so my eyesight dramatically improved. Whereas before anything more than a couple feet away from my face was blurry and fuzzy, I began to be able to see distant cars, people and buildings. I hadn&#8217;t been able to see this good in years without glasses. What follows is the not-so-exciting story of what I did during that hour.</p>
<p>I sat down under a shady tree and set to work&#8230;or more accurately, rest. I tried to read the address on the house across the street. No luck. I tried to read some street signs. Nothing. I looked at some signs at the bank one door down. Fuzzy.It&#8217;s hopeless, I thought.</p>

<p>I kept at it and slowly noticed that if I relaxed and tried to focus on the words they&#8217;d get less fuzzy. I tried this on several things without much effect.</p>

<p>I decided to test just how bad my eyesight was. I picked a sign that said:</p><blockquote>PARKING -><br />
DRIVE-IN -></blockquote><p>as I will likely never forget. I started walking backwards&#8230; <em>good, good, good&#8230;</em> then fuzziness. I relaxed and tiried to focus and suddenly the words became clear. I kept walking backwards and got a fair distance before I was distracted. Ugh, everything was fuzzy again.</p>

<p>I walked back up until it came into focus and started walking back again. I repeated this process, walking forwards and backwards along the grass next to the sidewalk for a while (I wonder what the people thought of me) and noticed I was getting fathter each time! Wow, I was past the tree where I first sat down and couldn&#8217;t see anything. Suddenly cars and flowers came into focus better than Ithey&#8217;d had before at this distance. I was able to read some of the street signs if I tried hard.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes (quite literally!) even without working to focus I was still able to see things better than usual. I decided to pick a shaded &#8220;NO PARKING any time&#8221; sign (it was much harder to see shaded things) and try my luck with that. I got a good distance back before I had to go home.</p>

<p>As I walked home I thought about the eye doctors&#8212;how could they sell people glasses when there was a workable alternative? Why wouldn&#8217;t they educate people like me about their eyes, or at least do more research into it? I cynically decided that they didn&#8217;t want to put the profits they made from selling glasses and eye prescriptions into jeopardy by teaching people how to make their eyes better instead of worse.</p>

<p>My parents thought my scheme was crazy nonsense. Some sort of placebo effect or some weird thing that wouldn&#8217;t work for anyone else. All I can say is that I can really see the difference now. Even measurements I&#8217;ve set up at home to test my eyes are now not only readible but clear.</p>

<p>I hope to continue this practice whenever I have time to spare or take a break. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll report on my findings here.</p>
