	<h1>OSCON: Final Night</h1>

<div class="content">
<p>My stay at OSCON ended short but my last night was by far the best time I had. At <cite>Writing for O&#8217;Reilly</cite> told us stories of his history as a writer, editor and bookbinder. He discussed O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s policies and process and gave all around good advice. </p>

<p>Then Aron Wall got me playing his eponymous self-modifying and open source card game, which was wonderful! He should be posting some instructions on his website soon but his technical precision (&#8220;you play the card on yourself or on someone else depending on your relative affection for either&#8221;) and his own brand of Wallisms (&#8220;th<em>a</em>t would be <em>in</em>teresting&#8221; he responded when asked if &#8220;Socialism&#8221; should be played). It was great to be with the other Wall children, they&#8217;re incredibly bright and clever. Fellow player Schuyler suggested that the game should be called &#8220;Semantics&#8221; since it was all about arguing and word changing. We had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Afterwards I headed over to <cite>Something Interesting Dominus is Working On</cite> (I couldn&#8217;t resist the name!) and even though I&#8217;d missed his presentation, Dominus recapped things for us. Across the hall in the Music BOF we had some lovely music from assorted programmers with voices, guitars, flutes and pianos. I&#8217;ll never forget the sight of Eric Raymond singing the <cite>Masochism Tango</cite>.</p>

<p>After that I headed up to the Perl party (my algorithm for finding parties is unstoppable: sit around downstairs until somebody asks me if I&#8217;m coming to the party, then follow them) where we pakced into Nat Torkington&#8217;s apartment for a night of heady discussions.</p>

<p>I had to leave the next morning and miss some great presentations, but I had a wonderful time anyway.</p>
