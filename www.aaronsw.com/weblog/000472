	<h1>Ethics By Analogy</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>For some reason I really learn a lot about things by analogy. I&#8217;m not sure if this is because my brain is poorly wired or that there&#8217;s valuable information I&#8217;ve developed for other situations that I&#8217;m just moving over. Does anyone else think this way? (Additionally, my memory is indexed based on space/location, not time like many of my friends.)</p>

<p>As an example, I was able to think about free software licensing by thinking about my toaster. And why ICANN sucks is clear if you think of them as the dictators of a new planet (cyberspace). Just now I think I solve the <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/002810.php#002810">challenge in a post by Glenn Reynolds</a> by thinking about playground bullies.</p>

<p>Hm, the common theme seems to be moral/ethical questions and outrage. I&#8217;d be angry if someone locked me out of my own toaster, why shouldn&#8217;t I feel the same way about my operating system? I&#8217;d revolt if ICANN tried to pass laws to govern the entire planet, why not when they try to govern all domain names? And I&#8217;m not too upset when the little guy teaches the playground bully a lesson, isn&#8217;t the US similar?</p>

<p>I suppose we develop a sense of morals from context and situations. Perhaps by making the connection between seemingly abstract areas of technology to these everyday situations clear, the morally right choice comes into focus.</p>
