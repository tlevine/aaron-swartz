<p>Over <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$2267?mode=day">on Doc Searls&#8217; DG, Timothy Philips makes a really profound statement</a>: &#8220;Copyright law exists to enlarge the public domain. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>On its face it seemed false to me, which is why it&#8217;s so interesting. Copyright law is certainly counter-intuitive&#8212;we lock things up so that more things will be free? It&#8217;s very close to the GPL in fact&#8212;the GPL adds more restrictions so that other works will have less.</p>

<p>Certainly current copyright law hasn&#8217;t lived up to these goals. The public domain hasn&#8217;t gotten much larger since 1929! This statement is a concise way of explaining why copyright must serve the public and protect progress and it certainly makes you think. Thanks, Timothy.</p>

<p>It seems clear to me that this is the next battle. Once we&#8217;ve stopped the absurd regulations like the DMCA and Coble&#8217;s bill, we need to go back and remove all the crud that&#8217;s been added to copyright law over the years. I&#8217;d love to see it pushed back to fourteen years, renewable once. Even retroactively&#8212;that&#8217;d show them! Stay tuned.</p>

<p>[For crying out loud <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/08/28#When:2:54:00PM">Dave</a>, [the Berman-Coble bill] is super simple. If I build a house and people try to sleep in it I can kick them out.]</p>
