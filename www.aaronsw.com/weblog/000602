	<h1>The Making of a Police State</h1>

<div class="content">
<p>Mark Bernstein <a href="http://markBernstein.org/Sep0201.html#note_20809">complained an airport screener was damaging his TiBook&#8217;s delicate screen</a> and got searched by the police for his trouble. &#8220;Is this how police states gather momentum?&#8221; he muses. &#8220;With a &#8216;reasonable&#8217; intrusion, but one without responsibility or accountability or recourse? With summoning the police to punish anyone with the temerity to question [them]? (How long before we hear about theft rings at security checkpoints? It would be easy to palm small valuable or cash, people must leave valuables behind every day, and we&#8217;re all being trained never to question a screener, never to ask them for identification or to see a supervisor).&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark is the one who <a href="http://markBernstein.org/Mar0201.html#note_6849">also noted</a> &#8220;The next time a soldier in the airport orders you to produce your papers, try to think of a movie where the question, &#8216;Your papers, please?&#8217; is asked by the good guys.&#8221; </p>

<p>May Gilmore win <a href="http://cryptome.org/freetotravel.htm">win his case</a>. Incidentally, that site now links to an interesting <a href="http://cryptome.org/scoffair-bg.htm">fictitious article about Brett Glass</a>, highlighting the dangers of having to show ID. The scary thing is I thought it was real, although the fact that it mentioned civil libertarians was a bit of a tip-off. </p>
