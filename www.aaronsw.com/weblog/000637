<div class="content">
<p>I guess it&#8217;s time to reveal <a href="000609">the incredibly kind invitation I received</a>. As many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument for <a href="http://eldred.cc/">the Eldred case</a> before the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would be quite enough, but seeing such an important case&#8230;Dayenu! When Lessig asked me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn&#8217;t (and still can&#8217;t) think of anything I&#8217;d rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I&#8217;m sort of embarassed to have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by camping in line with us.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;ll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then <a href="http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-10-02.html">camping in line with Seth Schoen</a>, Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you&#8217;d like to come with us, let me know.</p>

<p>I was hoping I&#8217;d be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who couldn&#8217;t make it, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/05/opinion/05AMAR.html">as I read in today&#8217;s Times, only lawyers and those with official press credentials are allowed to take notes!</a> I think this is outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an interesting account.</p>

<p>In a related irony, today was <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/events/event_detail.jsp?SEID=15127444">&#8220;Disney Day&#8221; at Borders</a>, where they played Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through <cite>The Practice of Programming</cite>.</p>

<p>In an unrelated note, if you haven&#8217;t been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, I highly recommend it.</p>
