<p>Eric Eldred <em>himself</em> was just on <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/">Marketplace</a>.</p>

<p>NYTimes: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/business/media/07ARGU.html">Debate to Intensify on Copyright Extension Law</a> (front page of the business section, below the fold). &#8220;It will fall to Mr. Lessig, who is a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and who has become a kind of rock star for the digital liberties set, to convince the justices to accept the unconventional analysis.  If they do, the decision could be a turning point in redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers&#8212;and the technology companies that are often in the middle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Newsweek: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/817175.asp">Glitterati vs. Geeks</a>. &#8220;Larry Lessig admits it: he&#8217;s nervous. Who wouldn&#8217;t be? [&#8230;] In its narrowest context, Eldred v. Ashcroft deals with the seemingly arcane issue of the length of copyrights for books, films and music. But it&#8217;s actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in the age of the Internet.&#8221; &#8216;There&#8217;s a sense of deja vu to this. Television was supposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industry&#8217;s silver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that &#8220;the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.&#8221; (Video sales are now the studios&#8217; biggest moneymaker.) Naturally, Hollywood regards the computer/Internet combo as scarier than &#8220;Nightmare on Elm Street.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
