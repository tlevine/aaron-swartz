<p>Yahoo: <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=127&amp;u=/020927/7/2bxul.html&amp;printer=1">The Case for Regime Change</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities and intimidation. </p>

<p>[&#8230; This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led by European forces. &#8220;Civilian casualties would likely be substantial,&#8221; said a French military analyst. &#8220;But the American people must be liberated from tyranny.&#8221;</p>

<p>[&#8230;]  &#8220;Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,&#8221; said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. &#8220;Their single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be retooled from its current military dictatorship model&#8212;in which a third of the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by the working class&#8212;to one in which basic human needs such as education and poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don&#8217;t even have a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will require many years.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Welcome news. The only way to crush America&#8217;s fundamentalist tendencies is by showing them who&#8217;s boss.</p>
