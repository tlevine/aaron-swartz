<div class="content">
<p>CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/11/iraq.us/">Senate approves Iraq war resolution</a>. &#8216;The president praised the congressional action, declaring &#8220;America speaks with one voice.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how the president can call it one voice when <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/07/iraq.poll/">half of America does not want to go to war</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/activity-log.php">Miguel</a> sent an email expressing his support to stop the war. He also told me about <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/print_article.cfm?itemID=2462&amp;sectionID=40">an article talking about how we have failed to learn from history</a>. He wrote: &#8220;most dumb laws are passed before an election and when there is a rush and no time to inform the American public, whoever takes the most hard-line position wins.  The same thing happening now in congress.&#8221; <em>Thanks, Miguel!</em></p>

<p>I wish I had known that such horrible things were going to happen while I was D.C.; I might have been able to join some protests or something. I feel powerless, perhaps I should move to another country. However, I am heartened that <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/vote1072/vote_00237.html">my senator voted nay</a>, I wonder if my fax last night may have done some good.</p>

<p><strong>Back to the mouse&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>I was rather surprised when I received a spam which began &#8220;Free Mickey&#8221;. But the next words turned out to be &#8220;Mantle cards&#8221;.</p>

<p>The New York Times ran <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/opinion/11FRI2.html?pagewanted=print">an editorial asking the court to overturn CTEA</a>. I&#8217;ll also note that Lessig called the act &#8220;Sateeya&#8221;, like some old female friend. They sure have spent a lot of time together.</p>

<p><strong>On a totally different note&#8230;</strong></p>
