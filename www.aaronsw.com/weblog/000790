	<h1>How Misleading Can You Get?</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>The RIAA has a website, musicunited.org, which among other obviously misleading statements has <a href="http://www.musicunited.org/2_thelaw.html">a page on the law</a> that strongly implies visiting a copyrighted web page could get you a $250,000 fine and five years in jail.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What the Courts Have to Say About Illegal Uploading and Downloading</strong> </p>

<p>[&#8230;] &#8220;When a person browses a website, and by so doing displays the [copyrighted] Handbook, a copy of the Handbook is made in the computer&#8217;s random access memory (RAM), to permit viewing of the material. And in making a copy, even a temporary one, the person who browsed infringes the copyright. [&#8230;]&#8221;</p>

<p>[&#8230;] If you do not have legal permission, and you go ahead and copy or distribute copyrighted music anyway, you can be prosecuted in criminal court and/or sued for damages in civil court. Criminal penalties for first-time offenders can be as high as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.</p></blockquote><p>Of course they omit the fact that these criminal penalties are only for those who have willfully copied more than $1000 (retail value) of material in a 180-day period. And I really hope the RAM argument is invalid; I much prefer the <a href="http://cr.yp.to/rights.html">server makes a copy</a> theory.</p>

<p>(Thought: if loading something into RAM is making a copy, isn&#8217;t looking at it the same? &#8220;The copy in her memory isn&#8217;t fixed, she&#8217;ll forget it soon.&#8221; Neither is RAM, it can be overwritten and will go away if the power is pulled. &#8220;The copy isn&#8217;t tangible, you can&#8217;t pick it up like you can with the RAM.&#8221; If you pick up the RAM, you&#8217;ll lose the data. &#8220;With the RAM you can make a perfect copy.&#8221; You can also remember some text and write down a perfect copy.)</p>
