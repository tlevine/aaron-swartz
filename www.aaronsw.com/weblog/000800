<div class="content">
<p>A relative came over. We wanted to play a networked game of Jedi Knight II with him. This is our story:</p>

<p>We set it up on the Windows machine: Mac1 couldn&#8217;t talk to the Windows machine. We set it up on Mac2: it required the CD to be in the drive of both of them. We tried to make a disk image of the CD: it errored the first time and got stuck and chewed up all the disk space the second. We tried to do it on Mac3: it refused to read any CDs we put in. We went back to Mac2: it no longer responded to keyboard or mouse input. We forced a reboot: it lost all the email settings. We went back to Mac1: it couldn&#8217;t see our DVD burner. We downloaded Toast drivers for it: we needed to upgrade Toast. We upgraded Toast: it still didn&#8217;t work. We reset it: it started working. We finally got the networked up and working.</p>

<p>Our relative had just left.</p>

<p>Oh well. I went back up to my room. My machine no longer responded to mouse or keyboard input, or to an external mouse I plugged in. But the screen saver kept animating and the volume keys adjusted the volume. <em>Aargh!</em> I forced a reset. I&#8217;m afraid to open my email program.</p>

<p>I thought this kind of stuff was behind me. I thought these things only happened to jwz. (<strong>Update:</strong> He was dealing with a, um, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=jwz&amp;itemid=139348">much more sticky situation</a>.) I thought it didn&#8217;t happen anymore. This doesn&#8217;t usually happen to us. What caused these six serious failures in a row?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to go open my email now. If you don&#8217;t hear from me again, you know why.</p>

<p><strong>Second Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.museworld.com/">Curt Siffert</a> provides a plausible explanation for the preference-losing problem that&#8217;s inflicted me and others:</p><blockquote><p>When the disk space is chewed up, the *.plist files can&#8217;t be written out when you try and quit the application.  I don&#8217;t know why the hell they aren&#8217;t left as they are on disk before you start the application.</p></blockquote><p></p>
