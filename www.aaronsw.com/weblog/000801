	<h1>Declaration of ICANN Independence</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776, <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/declaration/declaration_transcription.html">the Declaration of Independence</a> was signed. It presented a theory of fair government:</p>

<blockquote>that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8212;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed</blockquote>

<p>And listed the ways the king had violated this ideal. Today, many of them apply to another government: ICANN, the closest thing there is to an Internet government. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world:</p>

<ul>
<li>They have <a href="http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/random-bits/2002-June/000871.html">taken away the right of Representation</a> in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</li>
<li>They have called together legislative bodies at <a href="http://www.icann.org/bucharest/">places unusual</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/accra/">uncomfortable</a>, and <a href="http://www.icann.org/cairo2000/">distant</a> from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</li>
<li>They have <a href="http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200211/msg00012.html">dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness thei invasions on the rights of the people</a>.</li>
<li>They have <a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm">picked Judges with strong bias</a>.</li>
<li>They have erected a multitude of New Offices and Comittees (<a href="http://aso.icann.org/">1</a>, <a href="http://dnso.icann.org/">2</a>, <a href="http://pso.icann.org/">3</a>).</li>
<li>They have combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving their Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
<ul>
    <li>For <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,20293,00.html">imposing Taxes</a> on us without our Consent;</li>
    <li>For <a href="http://www.temple.edu/lawschool/dpost/Juries.html">depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury</a>;</li>
    <li>For taking away our Charters, <a href="http://www.eff.org/Infrastructure/DNS_control/19981106_eff_wipo_dns_comments.html">abolishing our most valuable Laws</a>, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments;</li>
     <li>For suspending our own Legislatures, and <a href="http://www.dnso.org/clubpublic/ga-full/Arc10/msg03900.html">declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How much longer will we put up with this? Must we wait until, like England, they have &#8220;plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people&#8221;? Some might argue we are already there. It&#8217;s time for to take control away from these tyrants who govern us only to increase their own power and wealth.</p>
