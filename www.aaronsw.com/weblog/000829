</div>

<div class="content">
<p>A property right is a positive right: it gives you the freedom to use, sell, etc. something you own. These are rights governments must <em>protect</em>, by preventing activities (such as theft or vandalism) that would endanger them.</p>

<p>A copyright is an entirely negative right: it gives you no new freedoms, merely the ability to prevent others from something they would otherwise be allowed to do. It gives one individual (the copyright holder) full control of a whole market (the sale of their writing). This is a monopoly, something governments must protect us <em>from</em>.</p>

<p>Copyright is not a natural right, but merely an outdated invention from the era of the printing press. To call copyrighted works &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; corrupts thought, by subjecting those who want to replace the invention with a more effective one to nonsensical claims of &#8220;you&#8217;re stealing my property&#8221;. To help you straighten out your thought and speech, I have a handy guide on terms to use instead:</p>

<p>Intellectual Property -> Intellectual Monopoly<br />
stealing works -> restricting freedom<br />
author&#8217;s right -> public&#8217;s need<br />
rewarding creators -> promoting progress<br />
taking other&#8217;s stuff for free -> telling others what they can write<br />
as American as not stealing apple pie -> as un-American as placing Apple Pie Police in every home to make sure no one bakes one</p>

<p>(Thanks to old posts of Professor Bernstein for explaining this distinction to me.)</p>
