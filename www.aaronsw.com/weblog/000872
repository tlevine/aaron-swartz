<p>Hi, I’m here at the AirPort, using the T-Mobile wireless. I’m sharing it by Ethernet to <a href="http://bensw.com/">my brother Ben</a>, who’s sharing it back via wireless so the rest of the family (and the airport) can use it without paying T-Mobile again.</p>

<p>On the way over I was marvelling at what a great idea autosensing Ethernet cards are. Before the intelligence was in the cable: you had to be sure to use the right one depending on whether you were plugging into a hub or an uplink port or whatnot. Autosensing puts the intelligence at the ends. I suspect this is a novel use of the end-to-end principle.</p>

<p>While I’m talking about neat technical things, I had occasion to use my bootable membership card. (If it’s <a href="http://nanocrew.net/img/fsf-card.jpeg">good enough for Jon Johansen</a>, it’s <a href="http://member.fsf.org/">good enough for you</a>!) There were a bunch of files we wanted to take on the plane with us, but they were on my brother’s Windows computer which required a password we didn’t know to log in. So I pulled the card out of my pocket and stuck it in. It found and mounted the hard drive automatically. I typed <code>trivial-net-setup</code> and hit return a couple times and it found the network and got an IP. (I’ve never gotten Linux to get an Internet connection that easily before!) I typed <code>/etc/init.d/sshd start</code> and it set up an SSH server. I copied the files off. It was great!</p>

<p>Back to the flight. Since we’re flying internationally (<a href="000870">to Japan</a>) I didn’t get to see if O’Hare has a &#8220;Children With An Adult <a href="http://cryptome.org/freetotravel.htm">Fly Constitutionally</a>!&#8221; thing. </p>

<p>We’re AA 153, and we’ll be boarding soon. <a href="http://tracker.flightview.com/fvUSAToday/FlightViewCGI.exe?Qtype=htm&amp;AL=AA&amp;ACId=153&amp;DEPAP=ORD&amp;ARRAP=NRT">Watch us!</a></p>
