<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/21/technology/21AMAZ.html?ex=1374206400&amp;en=f3c6539cd1b29480&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">The New York Times reports</a> that Amazon is considering a service to allow their users to do a full-text search on the text of all books, and then view the surrounding excerpt. When combined with Amazon’s tabs for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/562436/">Movie Showtimes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/913908/">Restaurants</a> (including scanned menus), the Times suggests, it almost looks like Amazon is trying to compete with Google.</p>

<p>This reminds me of an idea I had the other day: TV searching. Google hooks up a bunch of their machines to video capture cards and begins recording all the TV channels. Then, they make a full-text available using the closed captioning information.</p>

<p>So, let’s say you’re curious about Howard Dean’s stance of smallpox vaccinations. You Google TV for “Howard Dean smallpox” and get back a bunch of animated GIFs showing key scenes (basically a still whenever the picture majorly changes) from the surrounding show, perhaps with a short textual excerpt from cleaned up closed captioning data. You can quickly scan and pick out the one you want — an interview with Dean on Meet the Press. Google then streams the TV excerpt to you live so you can see and hear first-hand what Dean said.</p>

<p>Google’s mission is to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Giving people access to the content they see on TV would go a long way towards this.</p>

<p>If Google isn’t up for this, maybe the Internet Archive is. They have <a href="http://www.televisionarchive.org/">a Television Archive of news around the world after September 11</a>. What about the rest of time?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Rob Hague points out <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/dart/attv/">AT&amp;TV</a>, an AT&amp;T Cambridge research project which did essentially what I describe. The screenshots look awesome.</p>

<p>Joel Abrams and Paul Bausch pointed to <a href="http://consumer.tveyes.com/">TVEyes</a>, whose free consumer service will email you an excerpt whenever a selected word or phrase comes through in the closed captioning. Apparently they also have <a href="http://www.tveyes.com/">for-pay services</a> that do more.</p>
