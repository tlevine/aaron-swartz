<p>Some background. I&#8217;ve had all manner of computer bugs bite me, but I&#8217;ve never lost data. A hard drive has never crashed on me before.</p>

<p>Last night, when we started up our one Windows machine, it thought for a couple seconds and then said &#8220;Operating System not found&#8221;. We tried to revive it for a while with no luck. It looks like the hard drive cracked.</p>

<p>Then I found my server, <code>vorpal</code>, had been cracked into. It didn&#8217;t seem like the hole had ever been used, but it was scary enough by itself. Then, in the heat of the moment, I almost killed it entirely with a dumb command. Thinking it was dead I went crazy imagining all the trouble it would be to get it back. Luckily, it came back on its own time.</p>

<p>This morning my laptop, the machine I do everything on, started making loud clicking and scratching noises on its disk. I back this machine up regularly &#8212; the whole thing every week. Except, for no real reason, I hadn&#8217;t for the past few weeks. I scrambled to get everything off the disk into the backup as the clicking sounds grew louder.</p>

<p>As I tried to mount the backup, I noticed that I had encrypted it with a proprietary program that I only had on the encrypted disk. I managed to get a copy of the program and move the data to a decrypted disk, but something went wrong along the way and the disk wasn&#8217;t bootable. I tried to install the OS again over it to fix the problem, because the 10.3 installer said it couldn&#8217;t install 10.3.1, since it was newer. I tried to fix the problem manually, but that only made things worse and revealed deeper flaws. Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to buy a new computer.</p>

<p>You might not want to get near me this week.</p>
