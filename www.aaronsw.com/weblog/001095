	<h1>I&#8217;m Not President But I Play One On TV</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Every night when I turn on the TV, I see a presidential candidate. He&#8217;s the former governor of a small New England state and loved by the people (he&#8217;s won every time he&#8217;s been on the ballot). He&#8217;s very smart and a brilliant speaker. And he&#8217;s an underdog who tells the truth. He&#8217;s a moderate democrat, with a common-sense approach to foreign policy. And his speeches lift you up and give you something you believe in. His campaign manager is a frazzled balding political operative, a veteran of dozens of failed campaigns who finally managed to strike gold.</p>

<p>I could be talking about Josiah Bartlet, the president in the world of <em>The West Wing</em>, but I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m talking about Howard Dean.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know whether Dean watches the show, or if Sorkin is advising his campaign, but he&#8217;s following it by the book. For Bartlet, the turning point comes in Nashua, New Hampshire when a farmer asks him why he voted against the New England Dairy Farming Compact:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>BARTLET: [pause] (concedingly) Yeah, I screwed you on that one. <br />
	MAN: I&#8217;m sorry?<br />
	BARTLET: I screwed you. You got hosed.<br />
	[&#8230;]<br />
	BARTLET: I voted against the bill &#8216;cause I didn&#8217;t want it to be hard for people to buy milk. I stopped some money from flowing into your pocket. If that angers you, if you resent me, I completely respect that, but if you expect anything different from the President of the United States, I suggest you vote for somebody else. Thanks very much. Hope you enjoyed the chicken.</p>
	
	<p>The audience applauds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A similar turning point came for me when I was watching Howard Dean <a href="http://howarddean.tv/v2/streaming_pages/qt/hardball_256k.asp">being interviewed by Chris Matthews</a> (about a quarter of the way through; Matthews is a much better interviewer than I though). Matthews is hammering away at him about his draft record. Dean explains that he had a back problem, and that it would have been wrong for him to conceal it. </p>

<blockquote>
	<p>MATTHEWS: When you went into the draft board that day, were you hoping to get deferred?<br />
	DEAN: I was not looking forward to going to Vietnam&#8212;<br />
	MATTHEWS: Were you hoping to get deferred?<br />
	DEAN: [pause] (concedingly) Yes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like a moment of defeat. But then Matthews says &#8220;We got an honest man in front of us here&#8221; and the crowd goes wild. Dean&#8217;s got a big smile and you can&#8217;t help but smile with him. He came out and told you the truth.</p>

<p>Bartlet is supposed to be the man everybody wants for President, the real human being. Leo explains why he&#8217;s pushing Bartlet:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>LEO: Because I&#8217;m tired of it year after year after year after year having to chose between the lesser of who cares? Of trying to get myself excited about a candidate who can speak in complete sentences. Of setting the bar so low, I can hardly look at it. They say a good man can&#8217;t get elected President. I don&#8217;t believe that, do you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After watching him for a few days, I think Dean is the real deal. And his campaign manager, Joe Trippi, is doing everything right. Dean&#8217;s raising money from the grassroots, not the Democratic party elites. He&#8217;s got a comprehensive campaign finance reform plan. He has very moderate positions of everything else. He says what he means. He wants to overhaul the whole party (in his ads he says &#8220;I want to take our country, and our party, back&#8221;) and Trippi has suggested that we&#8217;ll see similar Dean-like Congressional candidates popping up all over the country. When you listen to Dean and Trippi you don&#8217;t hear prepared overblown remarks; they just answer the question honestly, simply, and plainly. </p>

<p>When Bartlet runs for reelection against George W. Bush (they call him Florida Governor Robert Richie) he&#8217;s decides to fight Bush&#8217;s I&#8217;m-just-a-simple-guy shtick by making the campaign about &#8220;mart and stupid, about engaged and not, qualified and not&#8221;. (Sorkin has said this was his way of rerunning the Gore-Bush campaign, and doing it right.) I&#8217;m not sure this will work for Dean, but it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if he does it.</p>

<p>Personally, if I had a moment with Joe Trippi I&#8217;d say this: You don&#8217;t need any advice on the primaries since unless a new candidate emerges you&#8217;ve got them sewn up. But when you get to the fight with Bush, you&#8217;ve got to make yourself the people&#8217;s candidate. I get money from average people, Bush gets it from special interests. I want to balance the budget so you get a job and money, Bush wants both overseas. I want to improve the environment so you&#8217;re healthy, Bush wants to sell it to big contributors. I&#8217;m the honest guy who believes in you, Bush is the puppet who&#8217;s misleading you.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just my advice, but if Trippi&#8217;s anything to go by, this is going to be one of the most interesting campaigns yet.</p>
