	<h1>Shorter George Lakoff: The Framing of Politics</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>George Lakoff, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226467716/coolbooks02">Moral Politics</a>, explains how the way we frame the debate seals the outcome. Conservatives appeal to people&#8217;s belief in a strict father. And this explains why all of George W. Bush&#8217;s actions, so hated by progressives, make perfect sense to conservatives.</p>

<p>Of course we have to stifle debate! A strict father allows no backtalk. There is evil in the world, we need to give Father a free hand to take care of it. Poor people are poor because they have no discipline. They need to learn self-reliance, not to feed from the government&#8217;s hand. But rich people are rich because they are smart and deserving. They should be free to do as they like.</p>

<p>Even beyond this worldview, they frame the debate so that you cannot possibly be against them. President Bush is providing &#8220;tax relief&#8221; &#8212; that is, tax is a terrible affliction we are curing &#8212; you want to increase the pain? We support &#8220;free trade&#8221; &#8212; that is, the market is a force of nature &#8212; why do you want to screw it up with your tinkering and regulating? You can&#8217;t disagree with them without accepting their worldview.</p>

<p>This is no accident. The most important part of conservativism is perpetuating conservativism. So conservatives have spent their time and money building organizations to control the language and frame the debate. They&#8217;ve gotten incredibly good at it &#8212; there&#8217;s a depth to it I&#8217;m only beginning to comprehend. On the other hand, the most important part of progressivism is helping people who need help, so progressives have spent their money doing just that.</p>

<p>Progressives think of the world in terms of a nurturing mother who helps people achieve greatness. And those undecideds? They use both philosophies in their life (perhaps they&#8217;re a strict father in business but a nurturing mother with their family) and are unsure of which to apply to politics. Lakoff&#8217;s polls show the country is divided evenly among these groups: one third conservative, one third liberal, one third undecided.</p>

<p>This is why it&#8217;s a mistake to aim for the center. There is no center to pick up! Those undecideds are trying to figure out which model they should use, and they&#8217;ll probably pick up on whichever side uses the more forceful rhetoric. Moving to the center weakens your rhetoric, and thus your appeal.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also a mistake to campaign solely on the issues. People often vote based on identity. Some don&#8217;t understand why so many middle class folks in the south voted for Bush. &#8220;They&#8217;d be much better off with a Democrat!&#8221; they say. &#8220;And why did people vote for Schwarzenegger? He didn&#8217;t even take a position on the issues!&#8221; But people don&#8217;t vote based on self-interest, they&#8217;d much rather have someone who shares their <em>values</em>. Which would you rather have? A heartless politician who agrees with you just to get your vote or a person who shares your causes and concerns but disagrees with you on some issues?</p>

<p>The solution is to start comparable liberal organizations to begin reframing the debate. Lakoff&#8217;s started the <a href="http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/">Rockridge Institute<a/> to do just that. But it&#8217;s a slow process &#8212; it took the conservatives 30 years to take control. You need to get the ideas out there so that the terminology makes sense. But it&#8217;s not hard to see how to reframe the debate:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Progressives want justice and fairness. It&#8217;s not &#8220;tax relief&#8221;, it&#8217;s just allowing <em>millionaire freeloaders</em> who get all the benefits of our government without paying their fair share. It&#8217;s not about &#8220;free trade&#8221;, it&#8217;s about a <em>moral economy</em>. Tort deform only lets <em>corporate criminals</em> get off easy. It&#8217;s not about &#8220;gay marriage&#8221;, it&#8217;s about protecting the right to marry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to hear this and not think of Howard Dean. And, indeed, Dean has <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/040119/usnews/19dems_3.htm">credited Lakoff</a> with helping him figure out his strategy: &#8220;What you do is crank the heck out of your base, [&#8230;] and you&#8217;ll win the middle-of-the-roaders. Democrats appeal to them on their softer side [&#8230;] but the Republicans appeal to them on the harder side [&#8230;] So the question is which side appears to be energetic [&#8230;] That side is the side that gets the swing voters and wins.&#8221;</p>

<p>And you can see it in Dean&#8217;s campaign rhetoric: he wants you to &#8220;take your country back&#8221;, he wants policies that &#8220;reflect America&#8217;s values&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;your campaign&#8221;. But for all Dean and Trippi&#8217;s intelligence, they have something of a tin ear for rhetoric. When they say it&#8217;s &#8220;your campaign&#8221; it sounds like pandering, not sincere. (Perhaps &#8220;our campaign&#8221; would be better.) And &#8220;social justice&#8221; sounds like some sort of government giveaway (try &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;equality&#8221;). And just look at Dean! He rolls up his sleeves and takes a stand. He&#8217;s tough, he&#8217;s forceful, but he&#8217;s fair. He&#8217;s the fighting doctor, out to fix what ails America.</p>

<p>Quick question, and I&#8217;m not trolling. Honestly.</p>

<p>What is the moral rationale behind making the rich pay more taxes than the poor? I can see the pragmatic reason, but I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ve ever seen a moral justification. Since everyone is on a moral discussion kick around here, there should be no shortage of answers.</p>

<p>Someone, please enlighten me.</p>

<p>The rich benefit disproportionately more from society, so they should fund it with disproportionately more. (In addition, there are large portions of government only they use. Quoting Lakoff: &#8220;The federal justice system, for example, is nine-tenths devoted to corporate law. The Securities and Exchange Commission and all the apparatus of the Commerce Department are mainly used by the wealthy. And we&#8217;re all paying for it.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Would it make sense then to tax the usage of things through use fees (or something similarily named), and have a minimalist base tax that funded nat&#8217;l security and other things that would be hard to pidgeon-hole with a use tax? For instance, if you were poor and didn&#8217;t own a car, you wouldn&#8217;t pay road tolls. If you were rich and took your yacht out, you would pay a port tax. And so forth. Is there a way to measure &#8220;disproportionately more&#8221; and charge accordingly?</p>

<p>Just throwing the idea out for discussion&#8230;</p>

<p>Chris Karr: &#8220;disproportionately&#8221; is a moral term itself. The whole existence of a society that supports multimillionaires might be said to be of far greater benefit to those multimillionaires than people at the poverty line.</p>

<p>An idea of &#8220;Everyone pays exactly for what they use&#8221; gets hard to determine when &#8220;use&#8221; is society itself.</p>

<p>Even the &#8220;flat taxers&#8221; admit this to some extent - only the most extreme argue for a flat <em>amount</em>. When they say &#8220;flat&#8221;, they mean <em>constant rate</em>. But there&#8217;s no obvious reason the rate should be constant, and plenty to think it in fact should be a variable. Only in the most disconnected sense (ignoring &#8220;utility&#8221;) does one dollar mean the same to a billionaire as to a beggar.</p>

<p>On a pragmatic note, would charging for use involve much more expense than would actually be collected from the taxes? Maybe in the Big Brother future, when all is known by the government they could do this, but would that be too big a step to take for the incremental benefit? Letting the government agencies know exactly what you are doing and when so they can charge you for it?</p>

<p>Also, if this model is taken, are you not moving towards a &#8220;service provider&#8221; mentality rather than the &#8220;institutional&#8221; one which currently describes government? Wouldn&#8217;t it be like trying to privatise the tax collectors?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not trying to troll at all (FTR), just am interested in how these ideas develop when you look at actual implementation as well :-)</p>

<p>So if &#8220;disproportionately&#8221; is a moral term in itself, how can we ever expect society to arrive at some sort of consensus with respect to who should be charged how much? Is it that we appeal to people, hoping that most agree with our fuzzy concept of &#8220;disproportionate&#8221;, or is there some way we can take the problem from the qualitative realm to the quantitative realm and actually show &#8220;Rich Person on average uses the following services A, B, and C. These services cost the state X. On the other hand, Poor Person uses only service D, which costs the state X/10. Thus Poor Person should pay 1/10 the amount of taxes of Rich Person.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the other hand, I also like looking at the actual value of a dollar possessed by the rich and the value of that same dollar if it were possessed by the poor and taxing based upon this type of value. Is there / has there ever been a 
some sort of research on this that quantitatively described this value and how it changes as income changes?</p>

Similarly, these same folks tend to label any mixed economy as &#8220;socialist&#8221; and its proponents as  (my least favorite term, of no informative value whatsoever) &#8220;statist&#8221;.

<p>Aaron, I appreciate your honest effort to structure the issues to form compelling understanding, but we&#8217;ve got to do better than how Dean (Lakoff) presents things.</p>

<p>First of all, the benefit of society is the transaction. Simplify laws by shedding social taxation and tax every transaction. Then the rich person - with more transactions &#8212; pays more taxes. Then decide a level of taxation that does not stifle commerce. That sets the pool available for government to use for defense, justice, and social safety net.</p>

<p>It oversimplifies things to say that it is better to go with either the strict father or nurturing mother approach. To run with the family analogy, families work best when there is a balance of the two (I&#8217;d lean towards mostly nurture plus occasionally strict).</p>

<p>The key is that these two approaches are situational, not categorical. By having a balance of positions, it doesn&#8217;t mean you water down your opinions, it means you are being both more pragmatic and more intelligent.</p>

<p>By the mathematics of your argument &#8212; 1/3 conservative, 1/3 progressive, 1/3 combination &#8212; I think it is arguably a better approach to go towards the middle. I don&#8217;t think Dean is the best case study for the left. A Kucinich would be more apppropriate. But running with Dean, you could constrast him with Clinton, or currently Clark, whose moderate views don&#8217;t imply blandness but a more realistic and thoughtout approach.</p>

<p>It is easy to forget that Bush ran as more of a centrist and it has been his time in office that has been so conservative. But ultimately, the middle elects people. Hell, if taking the hard line got you elected, why didn&#8217;t Nader get more of the vote in 2000?</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out over the nomination period. I think Dean&#8217;s success heretofore speaks more to opportunism than policy. A careful examination of Dean&#8217;s policies show him to be more moderate and, in some cases, very conservative (specifically in his states-rights stances). His &#8220;progressive&#8221; views are more progressive-in-sheeps clothing. People give Dean crap from coming from Park Avenue, but his style is more Madison Avenue than anything else (zing).</p>

<p>Chris, I was simply explaining how Dean frames himself (it was not praise). I don&#8217;t see why this requires taking a position on him politically. I could have similarly described George Bush (&#8220;The friendly average Joe who just wants Washington to work better, but who has been elevated to a hero by the events of 9/11 and is now a tough hand to steer the country in the right direction, while staring down evildoers.&#8221;), but that would probably be less interesting to most readers. </p>

<p>This was a pretty interesting post, and I&#8217;m more familiar with Lakoff&#8217;s straight Linguistics stuff so it was nice to read his analysis.  But this paragraph is uncharacteristically weak:</p>

<blockquote>
This is no accident. The most important part of conservativism is perpetuating conservativism. So conservatives have spent their time and money building organizations to control the language and frame the debate. They’ve gotten incredibly good at it — there’s a depth to it I’m only beginning to comprehend. On the other hand, the most important part of progressivism is helping people who need help, so progressives have spent their money doing just that.

<p>Just assumption of the term &#8220;progressive&#8221; over the past century and in this paragraph should raise an eyebrow.  It&#8217;s not as though &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are alone guilty in co-opting terms and using them to frame the debate; pretending that progressives have no stock in perpetuating progressivism and that conservatives seek to promote no coherent set of values is disingenuous.  Affirmative action, anti-choice, peace movement, social assistance, Head Start, who could be against such things?   How about the Great Leap Forward?  Also, there are a lot of folks on the other side of the web that would argue that large swaths of acedemia and academic funding have become dedicated to perpetuating progressivism at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>On the other side of the argument over rhetoric <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002979.html">Calpundit had a recent post</a> that essentially argues that Liberalism has become so embedded in America since the New Deal that we aren&#8217;t even aware of how strongly Liberal rhetoric has infused our political dialogue.  I&#8217;d tend to agree with much of what he says; most policies put forth by the right are framed to the public in what could be considered overtly liberal (nurturing, if you&#8217;d rather) language (&#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221;).  A textual analysis of Bush&#8217;s domestic speeches doesn&#8217;t conjure images of any strict father I&#8217;ve ever known.</p>

<p>Of course the truest perversion of the political debate and language in N.America is the perpetuation and undying assumption of the conservative/liberal dichotomy, but that&#8217;s a whole other post.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the moral rationale behind making the rich pay more taxes than the poor? I can see the pragmatic reason, but I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ve ever seen a moral justification. Since everyone is on a moral discussion kick around here, there should be no shortage of answers.&#8221;</p>

<p>IMO, the justification is this: the very high earners have benfitted (on the whole) more from society than they would otherwise put in, so they pay a higher proportion of their income as tax. For example, a firefighter gives a lot to society, but for a low wage. A rich businessman, on the other hand, is in the business of making money (as opposed to helping people). Sure, people do benefit from the businessman&#8217;s actions (on the whole), however this is disproportionate to the amount he earns compared to a firefighter. Progressive taxing simply evens this out.</p>

<p>Aaron, please go back to something I said in an earlier note. If you find yourself with questions that don&#8217;t resolve to useful answers, try rephrasing the question into those that do. </p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find that using morality as a justification seldom results in frameworks that are easily accessible to others across cultural lines.</p>

<p>I doubt that you and I are terribly far apart in the result we want to get&#8230; an efficient, functional society that (tweaking Bush and his opponents) leaves no one behind, yet fetters only minimally the rest. </p>

<p>And I&#8217;m the cockeyed optimist that thinks we can construct such a compelling framework based on each person&#8217;s own personal experience.</p>

<p>Another questions though, what degree of inequality is acceptable if it raises the standard of living for everyone?  (Rawls would say that the goal is to raise the standard of living for the very poorest person.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re at a point where people are  working much less because of higher tax brackets.  But somewhere between here and tax all income at 100% over $40,000 is a magic point where you are lowering everyone&#8217;s income by making everyone equal.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t worry too much about conservatives reframing that debate either, all of academia is to the left of Michael Moore.</p>

<p>Just a question and a comment, no answers :-).</p>

<p>By the way when you get to stanford you should take Debra Satz&#8217;s political philosophy class.  Easily one of the best classes there.

<p>I was just listening to &#8220;The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time&#8221; by Will Durant. Good read. He spends some paragraphs definging &#8220;progress&#8221; and Rawls conclusion about raising the standard of the poorist fits in well.</p>

<p>Redistribution arguments tend to spin out of control because, one, it requires class warfare to set the bar, two, it suggests that government is a better redistributor than personal spending/investing and, three, views that world as static, not dynamic. </p>

<p>Our solutions need to be dynamic: teach people to do things better, don&#8217;t just give them something. I vote for continuous renewal - community schooling to train people to do the jobs available. (And, obviously, care for those who can&#8217;t.)</p>
