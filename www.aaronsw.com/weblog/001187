	<h1>Wonderfalls</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Last week I saw the most amazing new show on TV called <em>Wonderfalls</em>. It had heart, and depth, and was absolutely hilarious. Plus, it looks <em>amazing</em>. The premise (girl in dead-end job gets talked to by higher powers) is a little weird, but the show is thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s received the highest ratings from critics across the country. The SF Chronicle&#8217;s Tim Goodman called it the best new show all year. And everything from USA Today to TV Guide to People to the New York Times to the Globe and Mail have said wonderful things about it. (<a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=17206">More begging and reviews&#8230;</a>) </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first time out of the gate it didn&#8217;t do so well. But fortunately (for all of us) it has a second chance: </p>

<p><strong>Tomorrow (Thursday) at 9/8c, Fox will be showing the first episode again.</strong> (The even better second episode follows the next day at the same time.)</p>

<p>I beg you, especially if you have a Nielsen box, give this show a chance. Watch an episode tonight and tomorrow (the show can take an episode or so to grow on you) &#8212; you&#8217;ll be glad you did.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re not a Nielsen family, I&#8217;m afraid, but we did watch the rebroadcast and enjoyed it quite a bit, and definitely intend to watch the new episode tonight.</p>

<p>You and my Tivo  both wanted me to watch it, so I did and enjoyed it immensely. It&#8217;s not the most clever show, nor the funniest, but the story, characters, and performances work so well together that you can&#8217;t help but love it.</p>

<p>Hmmmm, I really liked the first show, the second was not as good but leaps ahead of most stuff on TV. I hope it makes it.  Maybe it was in the edit but the second episode did not seem as sharp.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been finding myself home on Fridays watching T.V. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m exceptionally unsuccessful at this bachelor thang, but rather, because if I have to watch one more reality show I will go Bruce Banner on my new cathode-ray tube. All tables in my humble abode will be flipped and I don&#8217;t want to be held responsible to any damage afflicted upon society for my lapse in polite social ettiquette. These reality shows confirm my worst fears about a disassociated and uncultured society, lost ever since the cancellation of X-Files.</p>

<p>But I digress. Let me get down to brass tax.</p>

<p>The network show &#8220;Wonderfalls&#8221; has proven that strong writing, dynamic character development and fun compelling stories are not only found in Seinfeld reruns. Your lead actress has, as my sister put it,sass! I&#8217;m not one to argue, but my sister is younger and a little niave. The character of Jaye does not only have have sass, she has boatloads of undeniable moxie! Perfect casting. And what a great role of supporting characters. I throw my arms up in disbelief that a show like this, along with Arrested Development, can actually sustain a reoccuring spot on primetime T.V. in a culture hell bent on voyeristic programming. I hope that this is the end of reality T.V.. Wonderfalls is a shining becon to those of us who are lost in the mist of reguritated visual entertainment.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never written in to give kudos to any T.V. program on the air before but this show deserves it. Please keep this show on air. This is a satisfied customer. No more green skin. No more frazzled nerves over Who&#8217;s Going to Marry a Convict or such. My pulse is slowing, breathing easier. Anger subsiding.</p>

<p>Thanks Fox, that was a close one.</p>

<p>I absolutely adore this show!  The character Jaye is extremely funny in a dry, sarcastic way (which is the best way!).  The casting and writing is excellent.  I must say most shows these day are mindless drivel and it drives me crazy!  But this is a wonderful show.  I also like the shows Tru Calling and Alias.  I really hope all three of these shows keep going, TV needs some good acting! â€º</p>
