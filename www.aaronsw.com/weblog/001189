<div class="content">
<p>For months I&#8217;ve been working with John Gruber on a new project. The idea was to make writing simple web pages, and especially weblog entries, as easy as writing an email, by allowing you to use much the same syntax and converting it automatically into HTML. </p>

<p>Together we pored over the syntax details from top to bottom, trying to develop the perfect format, and I think we&#8217;ve got something pretty darn great. We&#8217;ve tested it extensively: on our blogs, in my comments form, in our emails. It&#8217;s all worked amazingly well.</p>

<p>The format, and John Gruber&#8217;s perl implementation of it, is called Markdown. I highly recommend it. It plugs right into Movable Type and makes writing entries so much easier and fun.</p>

<p>As John was getting ready to release, I did <a href="000918">another couple-hour project</a> and wrote the software to go in reverse: to take HTML and turn it back into Markdown. It&#8217;s just a first alpha draft, but it seems to handle everything I&#8217;ve thrown at it. (If you run into problems, please let me know.)</p>

<p>I dig it. </p>

<p>In response to the question about reStructuredText, I would just point out the contrast between these two documents:  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/rst/quickstart.txt">reStructuredText primer in reStructuredText format</a>  </li>
<li><a href="../2002/html2text/index.html?url=http:%252F%252Fdocutils.sourceforge.net%252Fdocs%252Frst%252Fquickstart.html">reStructuredText primer in Markdown format</a> (via html2text)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Markdown format is a lot easier to read, and probably a lot easier to write.  The HTML output from passing that html2text text back through Markdown is a little different than the original HTML document, but I don&#8217;t think it would be difficult to get it back to nearly the same result.  The point is the difference between producing a piece of writing and creating an HTML document.  Having to do the first by also doing the second is tedious.</p>

<p>I also dig that Markdown.pl works as a blosxom plugin out of the box. (Btw, if you use the writeback plugin, I have a 1 line diff for adding Markdown support to user writebacks <a href="http://greg.vario.us/software/writeback.patch">here</a>.)</p>

<p>You can write reStructuredText just about as lazily as you can write Markdown.  The comparison you make is a bad example, the source reST document has a lot of metadata, which means more markup, but it makes the output more flexible (i.e. a table of contents that makes sense could be automatically generated).  </p>

<p>Also, a lot of the markup is taken out by the markdown converter because the links are numbered instead of named.. which isn&#8217;t something a human would probably do for a document with 42 links!</p>

<p>If you take the metadata out of the reST document, or put it into the Markdown document (i.e. name the links, if that&#8217;s possible), the documents become largely equivalent in readability and writability.  However, the reST markup has been around much longer, has much more software that uses it, stable and complete APIs are available for Python and Perl (probably others), has outputs other than html, and it&#8217;s <em>designed for extensibility</em>.  For example, you can add arbitrary new types of blocks with &#8220;plugins&#8221;&#8230; you know, for those times where you&#8217;re writing something other than a weblog.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, (and perhaps the example is unfair) but the point is that Markdown is made for the purpose of writing for publication on the web without knowing any syntax necessarily.  Its un-syntax is the point.  It makes it easy for an email-savvy, weblog-savvy, HTML-unsavvy person to get their words on the page.  I think that Markdown is better suited for that (its purpose) than reST is.  The comparison between the documents was to point out the syntax differences: nobody writes an email like reST, whereas the Markdown source could have been sent as an email just fine.  If written by hand the links would certainly have been named rather than numbered.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive&#95;into&#95;markdown">Dive into Markdown</a> article is worth reading.</p>

<p>(Btw, reST seems great for other purposes, especially writing documentation.  Is there an extension for converting to Docbook? If so I may have to learn more about it. It may even have been a good weblog/discussion board post writing formatter, but I&#8217;ve never seen it used as such.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m actually working on a similar markup tool, spurred by my frustration with the existing &#8216;simple&#8217; tools - reStructuredText, Textile, etc.  They&#8217;re good tools, but the markup leans towards complex, considering their stated goals.  That&#8217;s my opinion of course, but I dream of a simpler tool. </p>

<p>Markdown looks to have some interesting possibilities, I&#8217;m interested to see where it goes.  I&#8217;m always amazed at how many people are attacking similar problems at the same time :)</p>

<p>My 2 bits is that plain markup tools need to do more magic.   Tools in general do, but markup tools should make specific markup tasks easier.  I have dreams of generating graphs from ascii art or from included csv data, auto-formatting recipes, colourizing source code (automatically of course) and the like.  </p>

<p>It seems to me that a user of a weblog software package will know HTML but the chances are much smaller a user will know a recently-invented meta-language.</p>

<p>Plus, HTML is a widely accepted standard that is useful in other contexts, whereas a new metalanguage only has one application (so far, granted).</p>

<p>If the user has a choice of learning something that is applicable one place and something that is applicable many places, wouldn&#8217;t they opt for learning something applicable in many places?</p>

<p>I find it strange not to find the word Wiki anywhere on the Markdown Site. Sure there have been ascii2html formatters before but not as divers or widely used. This created a lot of discussion which might have saved you a lot of figuring.</p>

<p>John, Aaron: I. Love. You. Guys! Thank you so much for Markdown.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never understood why people liked the cryptic, feature-bloated syntax of most Wiki packages (and Textile too) better than just writing plain HTML. Markdown seems <em>so</em> natural in comparison, and I particularily love the way you allow a mixture of ordinary HTML and Markdown syntax within the same file, and the intelligent handling of code examples and character escaping. Those are Markdown&#8217;s killer features IMO.</p>

<p>I think most Wikis (including the Wikipedia) could benefit greatly if they adopted Markdown as their default syntax option.</p>

<p>Why so touchy?</p>

<p>Is there a Perl implementation of reST, or a Movable Type single-file plug-in wrapper? As far as I&#8217;m aware, no. So, even without any arguments about reST&#8217;s syntax, I just don&#8217;t see how one could argue that I could have just used reST.</p>

<p>And if I was going to write my own code, there was no way I was going to write code to re-implement reST&#8217;s rather large feature set. I&#8217;m much too lazy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll happily admit that I was inspired by a few bits and pieces of reST&#8217;s syntax, but to be honest, when I was at the point of deciding whether I should write something new or just use an existing formatting syntax, reST wasn&#8217;t even in the running. To me, the best parts of reST are the parts it borrowed from Setext.</p>

<p>My major complaint about reST is that it requires documents be filled with all sorts of magic _s and :s  and ..s and other nonsense &#8212; Markdown seems much cleaner to me. (I also don&#8217;t like reST&#8217;s section syntax.) When I come across a reST document (and I&#8217;ve come across a number in Python work), it immediate screams &#8220;something is going on here&#8221;, whereas Markdown is readable, and often undistinguishable from a normal email.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure that reST&#8217;s age or increased set of software buys it anything &#8212; a format only needs one parser to be useful. I&#8217;ve never had much need for formats other than HTML and text. Markdown has already been extended (e.g. through SmartyPants) via its low-tech extension interface.</p>

<p>My best guess, however, is that a PHP or Python port would require a bit more engineering than a simple Perl-to-<em>foo</em> translation.

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it make sense to just use the [single bracket][SingleBracket] syntax that Markdown already uses and just process wiki links after Markdown. Since all non-existing Markdown link brackets  are still in the document after processing. That would keep it from adding a whole new concept.</p>

<p>You sould even use the [empty single bracket][] syntax for self-referencing wiki links.</p>

<p>In general I think it&#8217;s better to spend time extended, documenting or contributing to good existing projects rather than writing yet another version. In this case, an extension module for ReST or some better documentation could have acheived everything here, made ReST better and avoided wasted effort on two different projects</p>
