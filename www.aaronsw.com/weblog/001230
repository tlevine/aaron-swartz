	<h1>Completely Outrageous</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Bush <a href="http://factcheck.org/article.aspx?docID=177">runs an ad</a> which says that Kerry voted against &#8220;Apache Helicopters, Tomahawk Cruise Missiles,&#8221; as well as &#8220;Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Patriot Missiles, B-2 Stealth Bombers, F-18 Fighter Jets and more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth is that <strong>Kerry did no such thing</strong>, he just voted against general Pentagon spending bills 3 times out of 19 years. Kerry did say he opposed the AH-64 Apache helicopter&#8230;when he ran for Senate in 1984. But when he was elected, he did not oppose the weapons. </p>

<p>However, <strong>Dick Cheney did!</strong> Then Secretary of Defense under the first Bush, he said: &#8220;I recommended that we cancel the AH-64 program two years out.&#8221; He also specifically proposed eliminating the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the F-14, and the F-16 aircraft (compare with Kerry&#8217;s vague votes against Pentagon spending).</p>

<p><strong>No newspaper mentioned this.</strong></p>

<p>But <strong>the New York Times lied to make Kerry look bad</strong>. Commenting on the ads, Jim Rutenberg wrote that &#8220;Mr. Kerry has said many defense bills he voted against later were ridden with pork. Still, although he has complained that Mr. Bushâ€™s campaign has taken his votes out of context, he told The Boston Globe last year that some of his stances were &#8216;stupid in the context of the world we find ourselves in right now and the things that I&#8217;ve learned since then.&#8217;&#8221; It sure sounds like Kerry is regretting a 2000 or 2001 vote in light of 9/11 and the war in Iraq.</p>

<p>Nope, Kerry was talking about 1984 campaign proposals!</p>

<p><strong>To sum up:</strong> Bush/Cheney says Kerry did X. Kerry did not-X, Cheney did X. Newspapers don&#8217;t mention it. The New York Times lies and says Kerry feels bad about doing X.</p>

<p>Completely outrageous!</p>

<p>Once every four years your blog becomes unreadable&#8230;. <em>chuckle</em></p>

<p>The democrats may have had a chance if they had selected Clark or Edwards to carry the swing voters, but Kerry??  Come on, forget it.  Bush gave the poor people a lot of money in tax breaks&#8230; and I would almost bet $$ that Bin Laden will be capture a week or two before the elections.  Kerry won&#8217;t have a chance. </p>

<p>It is sad, especially for a voter like me (neither Republican nor Democrat), who isn&#8217;t given a real choice on election day.  While I don&#8217;t  dislike all of Bush&#8217;s policies, I&#8217;m not a zealot for him either. I wasn&#8217;t going to vote for him in the coming elections due to his support of the Patriot Act, but I can&#8217;t see Kerry as the president.   Nor can I see switching leaders while our troops are under so much pressure in Iraq - that is begging for another Vietnam. </p>

<p>My outrage is at the media. I don&#8217;t think things would be that much better under Kerry.</p>

<p>See, this is the strange thing.  Edwards really wasn&#8217;t that much less liberal than Kerry; his biggest campaign tactic in the primaries was populist protectionism.  About the only thing that made him a moderate was having a southern accent.  And Clark couldn&#8217;t come up with a coherent policy position to save his life; his candidacy pretty much consisted of, &#8220;Hey, he&#8217;s a general, so he&#8217;s <i>gotta</i> be good!&#8221;  Plus, he got endorsed by Michael Moore, which doesn&#8217;t exactly give you aces in the centrist department.</p>

<p>Though I guess this is a pretty good description of the state of our political discourse.  Edwards looks good on TV, ergo he was the strongest candidate.  Woo.</p>

<p>Eh, saying &#8220;Kerry did no such thing&#8221; is over the edge.  He did vote against those things when he voted against those general spending bills.  It&#8217;s a fact, Jack, that he voted against those items.  It&#8217;s also a fact that saying he voted against those items is deceptive (given the context).</p>

<p>I am not justifying the deception, but it isn&#8217;t like this is only with Bush.  Just tonight I heard Kerry talking about how Bush said he would work to get health care for everyone who couldn&#8217;t afford it, and that time is running out for him to accomplish that, and that Kerry would introduce legislation to accomplish that as soon as he took office.</p>

<p>What Kerry doesn&#8217;t mention is that the President does not introduce legislation and that he, as a Senator, could introduce that legislation <em>right now.</em>  Why won&#8217;t he?  Because he knows it will be picked apart and people will see the cost and he will look bad and it will hurt his chances at election in November.</p>

<p>Bleah.</p>

<p>Erik, I agree with you, Clark was a horrible candidate.  I think Dean sucked too.  Edwards was OK, but  I think Kerry is the best candidate for the Democrats.  Of course, I said that before Iowa, so I am gonna stick with it now.  :-)</p>

<p>(Actually, I think Biden would have been the best, but he chose to not run.)</p>

<p>Edwards was a decent candidate, but he was just too inexperienced.  Of course, we see what experience gets you: a record that your opponent can distort!  I think either Edwards or Kerry would&#8217;ve been about the same, but I think Kerry was overall stronger: a more experienced campaigner, a stronger presence, a touch of Dean-like anger.</p>

<p>Yeah, Kerry&#8217;s health care ad seems pretty bizarre to me. I mean, I don&#8217;t recall health care being a major campaign promise, and it appears that Kerry has only the one instance where Bush ever said it. But this claim is new so people haven&#8217;t looked into the details yet. We&#8217;ll see if the newspapers live up to their right-wing bias and correct Kerry&#8217;s ad but not Bush&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The first commenter said Bush gave the poor people a lot of tax breaks. Well, well, another case of bad information. How can someone claim such a thing when Bush did exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>I was about to say that I think there should be a rule stating that Congress and the President should always be from different parties.  But then I remebered that then, NOTHING gets done because everything has to be watered down to please one or the other.</p>

<p>And on health care - I hope we all realize that the day we&#8217;re going to have to pony up for socialized medicine is rapidly approaching.  Time to join the rest of the world.</p>
