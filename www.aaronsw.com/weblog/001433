	<h1>Of Conspiracies and Filing Cabinets</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>I hope to report in this space that the saga of the filing cabinet had been resolved. Instead, the story seems to go even deeper.</p>

<p>The filing cabinet, you may recall, was one of my first purchases here at Stanford. It stood attendant outside the door to the building, an unmoving symbol of my timidity and shyfulness.</p>

<p>Until, one day, the filing cabinet was moved inside and I received an email from the local RSAS admitting that he had moved it. I assumed he had found out about my weblog and moved it for me. Due to schedule issues I was not able to discuss the matter with him today, but he did not appear to know about the blog and said he&#8217;d received a note from the RFs who had received a note that it was mine?</p>

<p><em>But who informed the RFs?</em></p>

<p>Hush&#8212;the mystery grows deeper. The filing cabinet was moved to my door. I assumed the RSAS got fed up and did this as well, but he pleads innocence.</p>

<p><em>So who moved the filing cabinet?</em></p>

<p>It is clear there are vast and shadowy conspiracies out there, placing things in motion while well-hiding their tracks.</p>

<p><em>What are their aims?</em></p>

<p>I do not know, but it cannot be long until they make their pressure felt.</p>

<p>Be warned Aaron!  Look inside the filing cabinet before bringing it inside.. or, at least, before you go to sleep.  I have a feeling that you may find gentlemen with swords, shields, and helmets lurking within ;)</p>

<p>There are conspiracies everywhere&#8230; Once, for example, I went into my bathroom, but it was completely different! The shower was gone, and the toilet was at the other side of the room, and I couldn&#8217;t see myself in the mirror! And the next morning, I woke up on the floor.</p>

<p>I suspect the CIA was behind it.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s used to mommy or daddy carrying and assembling stuff for him, and doing his laundry.  Sorry, kid.  Now you must fend for yourself, learn to get along with and communicate with others, and learn your place in the pecking order.</p>

<p>Oh my god, where do you come up with such boring shit? Do you sit in your room half the time staring at your screen? Is this the output? This is singhandedly the most nerd-ass INSIGNIFICANT BULLSHIT i have ever seen someone document. I thought I knew what LOSER was until you re-defined it! GO YOU! </p>

<p>How do I become such a loser? Are there classes? Is there some sort of Simpleton Matrix I have to enroll in where D&amp;D is the prereq? How many pussies have you seen besides the one you came out of? (now, lets exclude the internet)&#8230;Have you ever seen a real one? Do you get out of your dorm and ever say, have a fucking beer? Did you know there are many types of things going on in this world other than you DOING YOUR FUCKING LAUNDRY? I ALMOST CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP LAUGHING. Good god your mother must have dropped you into a garbage disposal headfirst when you were young. Twice.</p>
