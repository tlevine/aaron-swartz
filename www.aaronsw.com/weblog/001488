	<h1>Stanford: Day 61</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>What exactly is life like here at Stanford? I take four classes, each of which has different components and requirements.</p>

<p>CS1006X: Computer Programming (Accelerated)</p>

<ul>
<li>Lectures, three times a week, recite material from the C++ textbook with flair, pizazz, slides, and household objects. They are archived to the Web. (I usually go to them in person.)</li>
<li>Section, once a week, goes over the material in a small group, mainly by going around the circle with each person answering a question. (Even though I know the material, answering such questions is still nerve-wracking. Since I don&#8217;t need the help, I don&#8217;t attend section.)</li>
<li>Assignments, once a week, require you to implement a very clearly defined program. Usually, they even give you a program that does everything your program is supposed to do, so you can copy its behavior.</li>
<li>A midterm and a final test your speed and skill by having you write programs and answer questions about them on paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>I moderately enjoy this class. The lecturer, Merhan Sahami, is a lot of fun. He tries to make the material &#8220;come alive&#8221; with props and even costumes. I know most of the programming stuff, but I still enjoy doing the assignments.</p>

<p>Sociology 1: Intro to Sociology</p>

<ul>
<li>Readings, usually about two chapters twice a week, consist mostly of sociological case studies so we can learn by example. There are also optional readings (one chapter twice a week) in a textbook which is more explicit about the concepts and filled with nifty stories and facts. (I always do both readings.)</li>
<li>Lectures, twice a week, are only tangentially related to the assigned readings and outline the major theoretical points of the class. Sometimes a &#8220;response prompt&#8221; &#8212; a graph or chart or something &#8212; is shown and little pieces of paper are handed out. If you write something in response on them, you get a better grade. This is mostly to encourage/reward attendance. (I always attend lectures.)</li>
<li>Sections, once every other week, are where we read <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> and watch <em>The Simpsons</em>. (I still attend because I think it&#8217;s part of your grade. I feel scared to speak up.)</li>
<li>A midterm and a final test whether you remember concepts from class (AFAICT, the questions on the book could be answered by simply paying attention to in-class discussion about the book).</li>
<li>One 5 page paper at the end of the quarter asks you to compare the entrance exam for Japan&#8217;s high schools (we read the book <em>Japan&#8217;s High Schools</em>) with America&#8217;s SAT (we read an excerpt from <em>The Big Test</em>, a book about the SAT). It&#8217;s due tomorrow. (I wrote mine on how Japan shows us just how bad America really is; I&#8217;ll post it with comments when I get it back.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I love this class, with the exception of sections, which are terrible. The stuff we read is pretty good. The teacher is great &#8212; lively and entertaining &#8212; and the content fascinates me. I spend lots of time after class chatting with the teacher about things and we seem to be becoming friends, even though she doesn&#8217;t know my name. (She even talked to me about the weather.)</p>

<p>IHUM (Introduction to the Humanities) 63: Freedom, Equality, Difference</p>

<ul>
<li>Readings, about one book a week, consist of Great Works (Locke&#8217;s <em>Second Treatise on Government</em>, Defoe&#8217;s <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, Ellison&#8217;s <em>Invisible Man</em>) and papers (Sunstein&#8217;s &#8220;The Anti-Caste Principle&#8221;, MacKinnon&#8217;s &#8220;Sexual Politics of the First Amendment&#8221;). (I think both are pretty bad and have gave up reading them when I discovered it didn&#8217;t matter.)</li>
<li>Lectures, twice a week, discuss the readings. (I&#8217;ve stopped attending these too.)</li>
<li>Sections, twice a week, involve sort of generalized discussion about the issues raised. Mainly arguments over things like affirmative action. (I attend these and talk quite a bit.)</li>
<li>Two 3-5 page papers are assigned. One is on Locke, the other on racial issues.</li>
<li>A final tests your recall of the concepts of the course. (I just found out about this. Guess I should have done the reading&#8230;)</li>
</ul>

<p>I can&#8217;t point to anything specifically problematic, but everyone (including me) finds IHUM to be a terrible, terrible course. However, I enjoy discussing politics in section.</p>

<p>Drama 180b: Noam Chomsky: The Drama of Dissent</p>

<ul>
<li>Readings, quite a bit once a week, consist of Chomsky&#8217;s key writings on the US or US-backed invasion of this week&#8217;s country. (I try to do these, but don&#8217;t always since it&#8217;s a lot of reading.)</li>
<li>Videos, a couple hours a week, consist of documentaries about those countries. (I almost always go to these, although they&#8217;re not very good.)</li>
<li>Discussions, three hours once a week, consist of that week&#8217;s presenter giving the history of the country and moderating a long discussion about what we&#8217;ve read. (I always attend these, of course.)</li>
<li>Of course, we have to give those presentations.</li>
<li>One paper 10-12 is due at the end of the term on a topic we like.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although I dislike the focus on foreign policy, this class is pretty fun and the teacher, a somewhat-tall man with a white mustache and an excited stream-of-consciousness manner of speaking, is very enjoyable to listen to.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<div id="c3489">

<p>Please update this blog in a more timely fashion.  It&#8217;s better to read and digest small bits at a time, and you may get more comments that way.  After reading three days worth of posts, I find my mind wandering.  Instead of commenting on a post I move to the next one, and forget what it was I was going to comment on when I return to that post.  If you have time that is, what with all of your school commitments, and falling behind on Chomsky.</p>

<p>I noticed you have quite the wish list at Amazon.com.  Don&#8217;t be hoarding all those books from the library.  Why don&#8217;t you write a small paragraph on your latest read?  It&#8217;ll break up the monotony of all the posts on school.  I&#8217;m also interested in several of the books that you have listed.  Then again, you can learn a lot from reading books, but it&#8217;s quite impossible to live your life through books.  No matter how hard you try, the lessons in life that will stay with you rarely ever come from books.</p>

<p>&#8220;put down your books, and start falling in love&#8221;</p>

<p>You should embrace the opportunity to speak up in classes - especially the ones where you already know the material. You can&#8217;t go wrong!</p>

<p>Why not attend the classes that encourage you to do this?  You&#8217;ll be a more well-rounded individual. After all, life is about interacting with people, not machines.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always fascinated with a college life that you describe here. And today I&#8217;m particularly interested in the reason why Sociology class compares the entrance exams for high school  in Japan and US. Isn&#8217;t SAT for college entrance? Or is it the whole point? Definitely I&#8217;d like to read your follow-up on this.</p>

<p>While you wrote about how Japan shows you how bad America really is, we talk about how bad both Japan and America really are.</p>

<p>I liked your weblog; both for its general contents as well as for reminding me of my own college days.  Undergrad was sure fun and one of the defining experiences in my life.  It&#8217;s been some time since then&#8230;I now have a couple of MBAs on my back, and at least 11 years added to the &#8220;old&#8221; count.  Anyway, I work in the IT field as well and I ended up reading your weblog following a Newsweek link.  Enjoy your College experience, you will never be able to live and have the same feelings / sensations / emotions.  Take care.</p>

<p>You only have to write about 20-30 pages a SEMESTER?</p>

<p>God, I think that was about two week&#8217;s worth where I went to school.</p>

<p>And reading was probably around 1200-1500 pages a week.</p>

<p>Lucky bastard. :-)</p>
