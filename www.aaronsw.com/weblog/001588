	<h1>Intellectual Diversity at Stanford</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p><a title="Guest Opinion: Forget Stanford's cardinal red -- paint it (almost) as blue as Berkeley (February 23, 2005)" href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2005/2005_02_23.guest23blues.shtml">A shocking recent study has discovered</a> that only 13% of Stanford professors are Republicans. The authors compare this to the 51% of 2004 voters who selected a Republican for President and argue this is &#8220;evidence of discrimination&#8221; and that &#8220;academic Republicans are being eradicated by academic Democrats&#8221;.</p>

<p>Scary as this is, my preliminary research has discovered some even more shocking facts. I have found that only 1% of Stanford professors believe in telepathy (defined as &#8220;communication between minds without using the traditional five senses&#8221;), compared with 36% of the general population. And less than half a percent believe &#8220;people on this earth are sometimes possessed by the devil&#8221;, compared with 49% of those outside the ivory tower. And while 25% of Americans believe in astrology (&#8220;the position of the stars and planets can affect people&#8217;s lives&#8221;), I could only find one Stanford professor who would agree. (All numbers are from <a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/afterword_v1a/afterword_v1a_singlefile.html#167">mainstream polls, as reported by Sokal</a>.) <!--The Stanford numbers are, of course, made up. --></p>

<p>This dreadful lack of intellectual diversity is a serious threat to our nation&#8217;s youth, who are quietly being propagandized by anti-astrology radicals instead of educated with different points of view. Were I to discover that there were no blacks on the Stanford faculty, the Politically Correct community would be all up in arms. But they have no problem squeezing out prospective faculty members whose <em>views</em> they disagree with.</p>

<p>Sure, some might say, but the color of a person&#8217;s skin is irrelevant to their duties as a professor while beliefs are at the core of the job. And to these critics, one can only say: you &#8220;knowledge&#8221; elitists have ignored the devastating critique of factual knowledge put together by the postmodernists! Objective reality is unknowable; our beliefs about it are merely &#8220;local truths&#8221;, cultural whims we could change at a moment&#8217;s notice. The only fair way to decide what gets taught is by what is believed!</p>

<p>But these far-left academics just ignore these <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002420.html">devastating critiques</a>. They continue to pretend their job is to investigate &#8220;reality&#8221; and believe things based on &#8220;evidence&#8221;, when everyone can see that these are merely absurd justifications for them to maintain their positions power and status over society. And, <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/keeping_conservatives_out_of_academe/">as has widely been conceded</a>, their advanced &#8220;search committees&#8221; and &#8220;hiring requirements&#8221; are just ways to prevent nonconformists from challenging their orthodoxies.</p>

<p>The party of McCarthy must save academic freedom. Wealthy businessmen must pool their resources to fight elitism. Racists and sexists must tout the values of diversity. Conservatives must embrace postmodernism. Hard work? No doubt. But they are bravely willing to sacrifice all credibility to protect our nation&#8217;s youth. We should salute their courage.</p>

<p>..stumbled across a writing by Rabbi Tilsen (http://www.beki.org/terror.html) which included a quote from Einstein that seemed deliciously relevant:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the case of a Christian clergyman, the tragic-comical is found in this: that the Christian religion demands love from the faithful, even love for the enemy. This demand, because it is indeed superhuman, he is unable to fulfill. Thus intolerance and hatred ring through the oily words of the clergyman. The love, which on the Christian side is the basis for the conciliatory attempt towards Judaism is the same as the love of a child for a cake. That means that it contains the hope that the object of the love will be eaten up&#8230;&#8221; (Robert N. Goldman, Einstein&#8217;s God, (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson) 1997, p. 51).</p>

<p>superhuman is a good word choice&#8230; didn&#8217;t Swift go insane?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s thinking like your&#8217;s that kept humanity in the dark ages for so long. I gather that if you had your way Stanford should have Professors teaching that things fall to the ground because they have a desire to be there instead of the fact that Earth has mass and therefore it&#8217;s own gravity. Should we go back to believing that the Earth is the center of the galaxy too? Societies, like their technologies will allways advance towards progress leaving the vestiges of what was once quaint but ultimatly useless behind. 
I would hope that an outstanding university such as Stanford would be too busy in it&#8217;s research to try to manipulate the political landscape of the future. Besides, by sheer nature of educating their students in pure science and truth, Stanford by default will be creating more Democrats for the future and there is nothing that can stop that but hate and disinformation.</p>

<p>Oh come on this is ridiculous. Who cares if these professors don&#8217;t believe in telepathy, demons or life after death. In my country at least, religion and beliefs are generally kept seperate from professional learning such as universities. Rather than seeing this as a lack of intellectual diversity, you can see the correllation between intellect and the supernatural. As intellect increases (Well I am assuming these professors are intelligent, otherwise this whole argument is null), perhaps faith in abnormal phenomenom decreases. I&#8217;m no professor myself, but I know that as I child I blindly believed in many supernatural powers, then as my intellect increased through growth I started to question these forces, which eventually lead to my disbelief in probably all supernatural occurances.</p>

<p>I agree completely with you. It&#8217;s really a shame that all these professors believe things so far out of sync with the mainstream population. But maybe they&#8217;re just following the historical precedent of other academics. Remember back when the masses still believed the earth was flat and the sun revolved around us? And then the really evil professors got possessed by demons and all started believing the opposite&#8230; generations later, all the masses got brainwashed by them to think its true. I say we banish all professors from this world and live like happy Amish. (Or at least force them to hire me as a professor so I can teach generations of children that the world is indeed flat. I mean&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t people on the other side fall off!! sigh&#8230;.)</p>

<p>That Republican beliefs are dismissed as similar to belief in telepathy or demonic possession supports the very contention Republicans are making: that liberal academia demonstrates a closed-minded orthodoxy that dismisses as invalid perspectives with which it does not agree.

<p>Nope. My question is why conservatives think there ought to be more conservatives in academa. The response is that there are more conservatives in the general population. So my argument is that universities are <em>supposed</em> to have more rational beliefs than the general populaton. I think the reason there are more liberals in academia is because intelligent people can pretty quickly see that conservative beliefs are based on illogic, falsehoods, and lies.</p>

<p>Therefore suggesting we have more conservatives in academia is like suggesting we have more liars in academia, which is like suggesting we have more believers-in-astrology in academia. It&#8217;s absurd.</p>

<p>What makes you think I dismissed conservatives without evidence? I&#8217;ve done an enormous amount of research into conservative beliefs and arguments. My conclusion is that they&#8217;re not based on the evidence. If you have contrary evidence, I&#8217;d love to see it. In fact, I&#8217;d even settle for polls showing that half of Americans really have different moral values which lead them to vote conservative. But until you do so, it appears to me that what happened is that half the population was deceived, which is no basis for arguing that half the university should be deceived too.</p>

<p>Unit, El Chingon: It&#8217;s satire arguing that the disparity of the Republican:Democrat ratio is no more evidence of bias than the Scientific:Unscientific ratio. Because it is only a satire and not a purely straightforward argument, it&#8217;s difficult to argue rationally against, as (being a piece of irony) it contains no outright specific assertions. The author seems to be arguing that the skew in both areas may be because professors are more educated, and thus more likely to hold certain views. (Those who are fully aware of the extent of the Bush administration&#8217;s blunders [the invention of crises while ignoring actual issues for concern, etc.] are less likely to be Republican.) He might also be arguing that while a person&#8217;s race or gender is irrelevant to his or her ability to function as a professor, one&#8217;s level of knowledge is not. So if the equation of Republican with unscientific is accepted, then the skew makes perfect sense. Again, satire is necessarily vague and tongue-in-cheek, so that equation should not be taken entirely seriously.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should read a thing or two about logical fallacies, specifically the false analogy, which you have just made by equating beliefs in the unscientific (like telepathy and astrology) with Republican beliefs. I&#8217;m guessing that, in your own sense of superiority, you probably believe in that analogy, but it&#8217;s a false one nonetheless. In fact, it&#8217;s just as false an analogy as the analogy the author makes when comparing the political makeup of the faculty to its sex ratios.</p>

<p>Jeesh, you guys are gonna be at it all day, arn&#8217;t you.  Oh well&#8230;  I guess I&#8217;m no better.</p>

<p>To review:</p>

<p>The conservitives have yet to provide proof that there should be more conservitive professors.  Here&#8217;s an idea.  Maybe all of the conservitives decided that they could make more money at corperations as opposed to schools.  Anyway, instead of comparing national average of votes, why don&#8217;t why doesn&#8217;t someone provide statistics of people who have the education and desire to be professors?  </p>

<p>The last post by Sundance was (I thought) a calm and rational explination of what the idea was.  The response by Orac said, &#8220;Is not!&#8221;  Why is it a false analogy?  Otherwise, your claim has no warrent.</p>

<p>The conservitives vs. women argument has been won by the liberals, in my opinion.  Conservitives, nationally, are not being burned in the street, or otherwise discriminated against.  If there is one place that they are less represented, and that place is a place of learning, perhaps there&#8217;s a reason?  Can any of the conservitives provide one?  (&#8220;We&#8217;re being discriminated against&#8221; is not an answer because it does not explain why universities happen to be the only places doing it.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a couple of other ideas.   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why is this such a big deal?  Ok, so Stanford is a liberal school.  There are conservitive universities.  Go there.  </p></li>
<li><p>Why do conservitive schools not do well nationally?   Why are the big schools, with good records, very predomanantly liberal?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Between these two questions, the conservitives have very little ground to stand on. </p>

<p>P.S.  Maybe Orac would like to provide proof.  http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/falsean.php</p>

<p>Aaron, I think we are kindred spirits. I&#8217;m a Canadian, a fan of Sokal, and so liberal that by American standards I&#8217;m off the scale. I have tried to study what&#8217;s going on with your conservatives.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I have to disagree a little. As you note, academe has been a willing home for relativist conceptions of truth, ever-more fantastical vestiges of Marxism, and so on. It is hard to argue that Republicanism has been rejected due to intellectual rigor. In general, the arguments one hears against Bush and his cronies almost as laughable as the ones used to support him. <a href="http://www.protestwarrior.com/">Protest Warrior</a> has made some hilarious videos about this. I know they aren&#8217;t exaggerating, because I&#8217;ve been to those protests, frequently. </p>

<p>It is true that it is <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/23More.htm">almost impossible</a> to find a supply-side economist at a university, but economics is prone to fashion as well.</p>

<p>I cannot find hard statistics right now, but it seems likely to me that Republican voters are just as educated as Democratic. This <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1198530/posts">Free Republic poster</a> lists some studies, without citations, unfortunately.</p>

<p>How then to explain an academic skew to liberalism? My guess: liberalism is more tolerant, more open to new ideas, and views life as an ongoing experiment. This is what university life is all about. Those who choose that life are probably going to be liberal.</p>

<p>I regret to say, I think both camps of American politics have a shaky grip on reality. I only favor American liberals over Republicans, because the latter are deluded in extremely dangerous ways.</p>

<p>Um. This might be how &#8216;liberals&#8217; perceive themselves. But as anyone who both read the transcript of Larry Summer&#8217;s speech and has followed the ensuing controversy recognizes, the professorial elite is not actually open to alternative hypotheses that challenge their particular worldview.</p>

<p>Summers advanced several hypotheses for why women are not equally represented in math and sciences. he explicitly advanced them as hypotheses worthy of further study. One of these three hypotheses was that  women&#8217;s skills in these areas diverged less from the mean than men. this is the comment that led to the outcry.</p>

<p>I only read the actual speech a few days ago, and I was honestly pretty shocked at the difference between the experimental, scientific-method oriented comments that he made as compared to how his comments were portrayed by the female professors who objected (specifically the one who walked out so that she would not &#8220;pass out&#8221;), and then how they were portrayed in the media.</p>

<p>I have no love for Karl Rove, Frank Luntz, or GWB. But the Summers incident neatly illustrates the lack of intellectual diversity in today&#8217;s elite universities. The scientific method is just as unwelcome there as it is amongst cultural conservatives.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that when we have an Academic Establishment vs. Brave Dissenters, there&#8217;s a simple rule of thumb to tell if the Academic Establishment is making sense. If the Establishment view is called &#8220;mainstream,&#8221; it probably makes sense. If it&#8217;s called a &#8220;consensus,&#8221; it probably doesn&#8217;t. For example, Googling &#8216;&#8220;global warming&#8221; mainstream&#8217; yields 297,000 hits whereas &#8216;&#8220;global warming&#8221; consensus&#8217; yields 348,000. I conclude that hysteria over &#8220;global warming&#8221; is probably unwarranted. On the other hand, Googling &#8216;darwin mainstream&#8217; yields 235,000 hits and &#8216;darwin consensus&#8217; yields 164,000. I conclude the Establishment is probably doing real thinking on Darwin&#8217;s theory instead of expressing a prejudice.</p>

<p>When we apply this to alleged paranormal phenomena, we see that &#8216;paranormal mainstream&#8217; yields 89,600 whereas &#8216;paranormal consensus&#8217; yields 19,800.</p>

<p>In any case, the claim by my fellow reactionary crackpots is that a liberal consensus is squeezing out legitimate parts of the mainstream.</p>

<p>bi, science is definitely coming up with solutions to global warming. In fact, we already know the solutions. The problem is, we lack the political and public will to implement any of these ideas.</p>

<p>Public discussion is definitely necessary. People have to get over their addictions to their big cars and SUVs. But most people are selfish and greedy. The only way we are going to deal with global warming, is a global attitude change.</p>

<p>We have the technology. We have the science. But the politicians in power continue to get their funds from the oil industry. So they will tell the public &#8220;hippies want to take your cars away and destroy your lifestyle!!&#8221; and continue to deny the existence of global warming.</p>

<p>In reality, with modern technology, we can still live our luxurious lives, without needlessly and inefficiently consuming too many resources, or creating too much pollution.</p>

<p>No significant change in society comes from scientists alone. There have been many excellent scientific ideas that have fallen by the wayside, because they have not been &#8220;marketed&#8221; to the public in a way to affect the public&#8217;s consciousness and lifestyle - so they remain in academia.</p>

<p>Think of mobile phones and the internet. If the average person did not understand the benefits, or the lifestyle changes that they bring, then they would not have been adopted by the mainstream as they have.</p>

<p>We need similar marketing for the environment - that environmentalism is about efficiency and clean, sustainable living - not living in a cave with bare feet. It&#8217;s about our survival and our futures, not being a hippy.</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230; It looks like a generalization based on Usenet (that the consensus/mainstream ratio is a guide to how much sense the Establishment is making) does not apply to the Web.</p>

<p>In any case, there is a difference between a conclusion based on multiple lines of data that have to be explained away and a conclusion based on one time series.</p>

<p>If global warming should turn out to be a problem (it might), the cure is quite simple: more nuclear reactors.</p>

<p>As for spying on professors&#8230; If information wants to be free, doesn&#8217;t that include information on what the professors are teaching?</p>

<p>But in this case, it&#8217;s not &#8220;information wants to be free&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;information wants to be 0wnz0r3d by us Republicans &#8212; and us only &#8212; so that we can use it to blackmail people.&#8221; If these Republicans are really for freedom of information, why do they advocate spying? Why don&#8217;t they ask journalists of all persuasions to sit in for each university course? And why is it limited to university professors? Shouldn&#8217;t we be allowed to spy on Bush&#8217;s conversations too?</p>

<p>There is a terrible flaw in Aaron&#8217;s reasoning which, being a charitable soul, I will at least point out:</p>

<p>Aaron writes: &#8220;intelligent people can pretty quickly see that conservative beliefs are based on illogic, falsehoods, and lies&#8221;</p>

<p>Which doesn&#8217;t explain the huge number of Republican professors at Stanford.  I am here to point out two possible explanations:</p>

<p>&#8220;1) It is possible that Republican identity does not require membership in a monolithic ideology; that perhaps fiscal conservatives or some other Republican sub-type are more rigorously grounded in fact.  The Republican Stanford professors might proportionately represent honest Republicans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;2) It is possible that Republicans have been specifically excluded from that portion of the Establishment which is wholly devoted to illogic, falsehood, and lies; i.e. that portion that publishes or reads avidly texts like that Social Text which Sokal so aptly skewered.&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8212;As I said, I don&#8217;t entirely agree with Aaron&#8217;s conclusion. However, your explanation #2 doesn&#8217;t square with the ~5:1 ratio of Democrats to Republicans in math and hard science (pace global warming skeptics).</p>

<p>Your explanation #1, if it&#8217;s going to do all the work, entails that honest Republicans are a very small proportion of all Republicans. I&#8217;m going to leave that one alone&#8230; :-)</p>

<p>If you want to find out what the professors are teaching might I suggest the place to start are all those books and articles they are required to churn out under the harsh regime known as &#8220;publish or perish.&#8221; </p>

<p>You know, it&#8217;s ocurred to me that I have no idea what the political leanings of my professors were.  However, I do know that one of the CS profs smoked pot.</p>

<p>The reality is that people tend to become leftist when they become educated about the world, and they later become less left oriented when they realize that their government is corrupt.</p>

<p>For example, what happened to the social security surplus we&#8217;ve been funding for the last few decades and why isn&#8217;t it factored into the national debt?</p>

<p>I really hope that this is a work of sarcastic satire.  No sane person could actually think that a lack of Stanford professors who believe in the devil is a problematic issue.  Please just tell me you were kidding.  Please.</p>

<p>Davol, you should read Barabbas by Lagerkvist.</p>

<p>Intelligent people get taken in by con-men too. Maybe not as often as stupid people, but it definitely happens. Some of the people who believe the right&#8217;s arguments are not stupid. They&#8217;ve just been conned. Our job is to show them that.</p>

<p>I understand you want to help, but statements like yours play right into the anti-progressive movement&#8217;s hands. They will be used by the right as evidence that progressives hate America and Americans. Real progressives do not.</p>

<p>Maybe people who complain about the lack of diversity (i.e. lack of conservatives) in academia, should also complain about the lack of diversity (i.e. lack of liberals) in the military and in the corporate world. </p>

<p>gripdamage: the Rightists who are just &#8220;taken in by con-men&#8221; are often not supportive of Bush, or at least have some reservations about him. People who believe this Evil Leftist Academic Establishment sh!t are obviously too far down the path of stupidity. As someone else has put it, they weren&#8217;t reasoned into their positions, so they won&#8217;t be reasoned out of their positions either.</p>
