<h1>2009 Review of Books</h1>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s time for my annual look back thru the books I read this year. (Previously: <a href="books2006">2006</a>, <a href="books2007">2007</a>, <a href="2008books">2008</a>.) I&#8217;ve included links to reviews, where I have them, and italicized the titles of the books I recommend without reservation.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Liberal Hour (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKO3K5WR85YB/">my review: 3 stars</a>)</li>
<li>Depression Economics (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WP6BGGG59R3/">4</a>)</li>
<li>The Great Derangement (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R32I4OZJU4C5UQ/">4</a>)</li>
<li>Politics the Wellstone Way (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLP4VN68PP0A/">4</a>)</li>
<li>Who Really Rules? (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RD66PCB1QYMH2/">5</a>)</li>

<li>For Common Things</li>
<li>Who Governs?</li>
<li>Supreme: The Story of the Year (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TF84EZX5F0W/">2</a>)</li>
<li>Changing the Powers that Be (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWTNES8RE9XJ/">4</a>)</li>
<li>New Kings of Nonficton</li>
<li><p>On Writing Well (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9RZ7Q6X6BRS/">3</a>)</p>

<p>This book is really dreadful, mostly because the author actually cannot write well.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245"><em>The Power Broker</em></a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOVNQ3JLY6GF/">5</a>)</p>

<p>I cannot possibly say enough good things about this book. Go read it. Right now. Yes, I know it&#8217;s long, but trust me, you&#8217;ll wish it was longer. I think it may be simply the best nonfiction book.</p></li>
<li>What Are Intellectuals Good For?</li>
<li>Priorities in Health (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3312XB4IFMO2R/">4</a>)</li>
<li>Invisible Hands</li>
<li>The Option of Urbanism</li>
<li>Getting There</li>
<li><p>On Directing Film (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QYA1TV8GOIJ/">4</a>)</p>

<p>Not just a great book about directing, but a great book about <em>writing</em>.</p></li>
<li>The High Cost of Free Parking (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R370YSX27EUSZS/">4</a>)</li>
<li>The Leftmost City</li>
<li>Outliers</li>

<li>Urban Fortunes (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R203162R8QOQ3D/">4</a>)</li>
<li>Falling Behind</li>
<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/052144585X">The Sources of Social Power, Vol. 2</a></p>

<p>Not an easy book, but Michael Mann continues to amaze.</p></li>
<li>Divided Highways</li>
<li>Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma</li>
<li>Running After Antelope</li>
<li>Cities of Tomorrow</li>
<li>Suburb (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R171OSWU5ATSOH/">4</a>)</li>
<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/097063241X"><em>The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces</em></a></p>

<p>If Feynman was a sociologist, this is probably the book he&#8217;d write. A delightful little thing.</p></li>

<li>Suburban Nation</li>
<li>Zoned Out</li>
<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674018214"><em>American Apartheid</em></a></p>

<p>This book is criminally under-publicized. Everyone has their own crazy theories about why it is that blacks are disadvantaged in our society. Massey and Denton show it&#8217;s much more obvious than any of that: they&#8217;re victims of extreme segregation, with all the negative effects that entails. An absolutely brilliant book.</p></li>

<li>City of Quartz</li>
<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844672409"><em>The Liberal Defence of Murder</em></a></p>

<p>This book is like a little miracle. I&#8217;m not even sure how to describe it, except to say that it turns one&#8217;s understanding of history completely upside-down.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0871545845">Categorically Unequal</a></p>

<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002SB8OMA">Gaming the Vote</a></p>

<p>Poundstone&#8217;s really become an amazing writer. While this isn&#8217;t as good as <em><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809045990">Fortune&#8217;s Formula</a></em> it really is quite fun. Poundstone takes a rather novel tack in making the argument for voting system reform. Instead of saying that it will allow for third-parties to get a fair hearing, he argues it will protect the major parties from the insidious effect of spoilers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, instead of IRV, Approval, or even Condorcet voting, he endorses Range Voting as the best voting system, arguing against Condorcet on some weird grounds about determinant ballots that just doesn&#8217;t make sense to me (p. 226).</p>

<p>Both of these seem reasonable when Poundstone lays them out, but are totally insane upon further inspection. Voting reform may protect against spoilers in the short-term, but in the long term it&#8217;ll likely doom us to some kind of fractured multiparty system. (That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s a bad thing.) And range voting, like its proponents, is totally batshit insane. (He even passes on their ridiculous claims about it being better than democracy with a straight face.)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s think about this for a second. Strategic voting with a range ballot (which even range voting&#8217;s proponents say they&#8217;ll do) is simply approval voting (plus maybe some meaningless nursery effect &#8212; if you want that, just have a nonbinding approval box or something). So for the system to work, it depends on people voting astrategically. But obviously those people&#8217;s votes will count less than strategic votes. So range voting&#8217;s only advantage over approval voting is that it counts the votes of naive voters less. How is that fair?</p>

<p>I think the Range Voting comparison with Condorcet is rigged; you&#8217;ll notice they never provide any explanation for why their supposedly strategic Condorcet behavior is actually strategic. And the only strategic Condorcet behavior Poundstone provides is trying to create a tie to force it into sequential dropping, which seems wildly implausible in a real-life scenario. So it still seems Condorcet outperforms them all.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674006933">If You&#8217;re an Egalitarian, How Come You&#8217;re So Rich?</a></p>

<p>I really enjoyed this book. It starts with a simple thought experiment: imagine you had a long-lost identical twin who grew up in a conservative home and became a conservative. You, by contrast, grew up in a liberal home and became a liberal. Wouldn&#8217;t meeting him make you question your beliefs? And thus, shouldn&#8217;t the possibility that you <em>could</em> meet him make you question your beliefs? (I&#8217;m not totally convinced by this; my beliefs are much more shaken by converts &#8212; people who were strong believers in X but converted to believing in Y.)</p>

<p>From this, Cohen heads to a reminiscence of his own upbringing, which I found especially touching, perhaps because he has the identity I wish I had: a Canadian communist in an antireligious Yiddish-speaking home. In the middle there&#8217;s a good bit on Hegel, Marx, and why not to heighten the contradictions, and he concludes by refuting Rawls with the same argument Matt Yglesias used on Kent Conrad: Rawls says that in a just society, everyone would embrace the Difference Principle, but the Difference Principle allows for differences because some people will work harder if they get more, but if those people embrace the principle then why wouldn&#8217;t they give their money to the poor and embrace egalitarianism? He ends by addressing the title question and accepting a sort of Yglesian approach to politics: an overriding concern with the structure of political institutions, but also a strong sense of moral demands for people to achieve they best they can within existing structures.</p>

<p>Finally, it got me wondering: a lot of Marx (and, I would add, Keynes) thinks about the future as some sort of society where industrial products give us abundance and economic laws loosen their hold on us. The industrial revolution didn&#8217;t do that, but perhaps the post-scarcity technological future might?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And my first book of the new year is Daniel Ellsberg&#8217;s <em><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0142003425">Secrets</a></em>, which I&#8217;m already loving.</p>

<p>How much time do you spend on reading? That&#8217;s a book every 2.765 days for a year, which is impressive to say the least! Glancing at the archives it doesn&#8217;t seem like this is abnormal for you.</p>

<p>Your comparison between Score Voting (aka Range Voting) and Approval Voting incorrectly asserts that Score Voting users have to be &#8220;astrategic&#8221; in order for it to work. That&#8217;s not the case. Score Voting achieves lower Bayesian Regret than Approval Voting with each additional expressive (sincerely expressive, or &#8220;astrategic&#8221;) voter.
http://scorevoting.net/UniqBest.html</p>

<p>Further, you basically assert that only &#8220;naive&#8221; voters would want to be expressive. But exit polling from the 2000 USA Presidential election shows that about 10% of the Nader supporters who came to the polls actually voted for Nader. Surely they didn&#8217;t do that because they were unaware they were &#8220;throwing away&#8221; their votes. They WANTED to express their preference for Nader.</p>

<p>If 10% of Score Voting users are expressive, then they are better off with Score Voting with Approval Voting, because it lets them do what they prefer to do &#8212; express themselves. And the strategic voters are better off because their average satisfaction goes up appreciably (the more sincere voters, the lower the Bayesian Regret).</p>

<p>As for the &#8220;truly naive&#8221; voters that you worry may be disadvantaged by Score Voting, relative to Approval Voting, I would argue that</p>

<p>A) They are a negligible fraction of voters, and to give up the substantial benefits of Score Voting to protect them is not reasonable.</p>

<p>B) They are quite possibly BETTER with Score Voting, because if they are that naive, then a sincere Score Voting ballot is probably MORE STRATEGIC for them than a sincere Approval Voting ballot. That may sound counter-intuitive, but I think I make a pretty reasonable argument toward that end, here:
http://scorevoting.net/RVstrat6.html</p>

<p>As for Condorcet methods, Poundstone does indeed explain how burial strategy can be effective. In short, the voter &#8220;buries&#8221; all the front-runners but his favorite among them. For most Condorcet methods, this strategy IS effective, as shown here with statistical analysis:</p>

<p>http://scorevoting.net/CondBurial.html</p>

<p>The fact that you consider the success of that strategy to be &#8220;wildly implausible&#8221; demonstrates a bit of electoral naivete. It is certainly implausible that a voter who prefers Ralph Nader can ensure that Gore defeats Bush, by insincerely switching his vote from Nader to Gore. The odds that it will make the difference are virtually nil. Yet we know quite well that the vast majority of plurality voters use that very tactic.</p>

<p>And empirical data (from e.g. decades worth of IRV elections in Australia) shows that most voters using a ranked system will just bury the strongest challengers to their favorite front-runner, even if they are blissfully unaware of the mathematics of the voting method. They just &#8220;intuit&#8221; that it makes sense to maximally damage strong opponents. That voters do this is just empirical fact.</p>

<p>And this type of &#8220;naive burial&#8221; strategy is extremely harmful in Condorcet systems. Whereas this strategy is NOT very harmful in Score Voting, because Score Voting passes the Favorite Betrayal Criterion and the NESD property.</p>

<p>http://scorevoting.net/FBCsurvey.html
http://scorevoting.net/NESD.html</p>

<p>You can dismiss Score Voting advocates as being merely crazy, but we believe the evidence strongly supports our viewpoint. We further have experienced that virtually all opponents of Score Voting overlook the same things you have overlooked here, or asserts that we haven&#8217;t proven what we say we have (as you did with Poundstone, even though he showed simple examples of how Condorcet burial strategies work, right there in his book).</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this list is that it doesn&#8217;t have a single book on it that I also read this year &#8212; wait a minute, yes it does! &#8216;Outliers&#8217; by Malcolm Gladwell. I didn&#8217;t want to read a book, but a friend of mine told me I HAD to read it. I said &#8216;no&#8217; but he kept insisting. Finally he shoved it into my hands. It was Typical Gladwell &#8212; a few simple yet clever ideas explained by laboriously long-winded stories. I hate it &#8212; I just don&#8217;t have the patience for that. But, apparently this is what people like to read, because Gladwell is one of the country&#8217;s most popular authors.</p>

<p>I was just about to ask the same question - 2.5 books a week. How many hours are you spending reading?</p>

<p>The average person spends 1704 hours a year watching TV. If the
average reading rate is 250 words per minute and the average book is
180,000 words then that&#8217;s 142 books a year. So I guess the answer is:
not enough.</p>
