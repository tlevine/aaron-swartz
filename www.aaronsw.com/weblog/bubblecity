<h1>Bubble City: Preface</h1>

<p>November is National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo. The idea, as far
as I can discern, is that more people ought to be writing novels. But
whether this is for us or them is not clear.</p>

<p>Novels have an odd place in our culture. They can be capital-L
Literature, as in the Great American Novel. Or they can be
entertainment, as in romance or mystery novels. Or, and perhaps best,
they can capture the essence of a place or time by using it as the
backdrop for a story.</p>

<p>In this way, a novel is disguised memoir, as anyone who is friends with
a novelist can readily discern. And, like a memoir, writing them can be
therapeutic, exorcising a writer&#8217;s demons, while hopefully being more
entertaining.</p>

<p>Over the next month I will be serializing a novel, <em>Bubble City</em>, in this space, one chapter every day. NaNoWriMo requires novels be at least 50,000 words in length and thirty days hath November, so I&#8217;ll aim for 1666 words a day, although if I get lazy I may make some days shorter if I go over on previous ones.</p>

<p>There are lots of reasons not to read
it: I have no experience writing long-form fiction, I will be writing
this live and thus bound to errors I make in previous chapters, you will
undoubtedly be negatively portrayed in it, I have not really planned
this out, and I have no great things to say. Each post&#8217;s title will
begin with &#8220;Bubble City:&#8221; so you can easily ignore them.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to read a yarn about the denizens of San
Francisco startups, the power they presume to have over the world, and
what happens when programmers get in over their heads, stay tuned.</p>

<p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <a href="bubblecity1">Chapter One</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure this is the way to write a novel.</p>

<p>If I were you, I would write the chapters as you intend, but also spend time rewriting and rethinking.</p>

<p>Then <em>next</em> month, post it as a serial. I think you&#8217;ll get higher quality this way.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
