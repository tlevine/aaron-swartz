<h1>Colombia is Bleeding</h1>

<p><em>Nellie McKay is having trouble getting her new album,</em> Pretty Little Head, <em>released, apparently due to the content of artistic differences with the record label. The best song on the album, and one that is particularly mentioned in this regard, is &#8220;Columbia is Bleeding&#8221;, her vicious portrayal of college life while students are oblivious to <a href="http://www.columbiacruelty.com/">the animal torture going on around them</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>However, it seems like the song might really be more appropriate for <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200412--.htm">a different Colombia</a>. Here, then, are those lyrics&#8230;</em></p>

<p>another day begins<br />
you check the news<br />
ah-sass-ih-nay-she-uns<br />
here come the footstep of the man who&#8217;ll end your life<br />
the rifle&#8217;s is fitted in<br />
and there you are<br />
the shot is targeted<br />
then a scream</p>

<p>hold your placard up / cold and coffee cup<br />
after go to a bar<br />
hand your flier out / must admire<br />
how dedicated you are<br />
i don&#8217;t wanna know if biz is boomin&#8217;<br />
or the goods you make are on sale<br />
i don&#8217;t wanna know &#8216;bout your <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Haiti/NoblePhase_GHRTT.html">&#8220;saintly glow&#8221; or your &#8220;noble&#8221; show</a><br />
or if you think you ought to bail</p>

<p>Chris Hogan / she had to run<br />
last night&#8217;d been a lot of fun<br />
but now it&#8217;s french / a little tense<br />
she hadn&#8217;t done the reading<br />
there she sat / hoped to pass<br />
didn&#8217;t think to face the fact<br />
that oh by gosh o lack o lass<br />
colombia is bleeding<br />
walkin&#8217; down / off the bus<br />
Vicky Lucas crossed campus was<br />
thinkin&#8217; how she&#8217;s made it now<br />
that successful feeling<br />
walked by fast / hoped to pass 
no clue &#8216;bout the shirt she has<br />
and while she&#8217;s sittin&#8217; in lit class<br />
colombia is bleeding</p>

<p>the union is in town<br />
and there they are<br />
the forces come on down<br />
then a scream</p>

<p>everybody knows protesters are those<br />
schmoes who don&#8217;t have a life<br />
see these businessmen seeking profit and<br />
have to suffer such strife<br />
i don&#8217;t wanna know if the world is flat<br />
or you can&#8217;t check your email<br />
i don&#8217;t wanna know <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_07_31_atrios_archive.html#112307924462696350">if your cell won&#8217;t work or that guy&#8217;s a jerk </a><br />
or if you think you ought to bail</p>

<p>generalize, proselytize, verbs were spillin&#8217; out their sides<br />
as Charles Eise buys his supplies gets ready for a meeting<br />
tried for track / hit the mat<br />
didn&#8217;t think to face the fact<br />
that while he&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; &#8220;man, that&#8217;s wack!&#8221;<br />
colombia is bleeding<br />
quite a snob he didn&#8217;t tip<br />
nice guy Rob watched the eclipse<br />
and looked around / &#8220;i&#8217;ve made it now<br />
i&#8217;m just so glad to be here&#8221;<br />
made a pass / got hand slapped<br />
didn&#8217;t think to face the fact<br />
that while he&#8217;s mackin&#8217; on that ass<br />
colombia is bleeding</p>

<p>the catholic religion<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology">decides to help the poor</a><br />
while we rename the school in<br />
<a href="http://www.soaw.org/">which we train the men</a> and<br />
then a scream</p>

<p>they&#8217;re just criminals / make good worker cells<br />
<a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm">pushing drugs and disease</a><br />
empire&#8217;s pretty fun / we got power, son<br />
<a href="http://www.afn.org/~iguana/archives/2003_11/20031112.html">we can do as we please</a><br />
i don&#8217;t wanna know &#8216;bout your drug war claims<br />
or how it&#8217;s gonna fail<br />
i don&#8217;t wanna know if you need to show you&#8217;re a real madman<br />
or you think you&#8217;re gonna bail<br />
hail!</p>

<p>Tee-Tee Green / pressed mezzanine<br />
ended up beside the team<br />
and gave a cheer / got some beers<br />
with friends who started drinkin&#8217;<br />
back with Zach said &#8220;i look fat&#8221;<br />
didn&#8217;t think to face the fact<br />
that while she&#8217;s under self-attack<br />
colombia is bleeding<br />
Rodney J. began to pray<br />
his momma lost her life that day<br />
had been a year / it wasn&#8217;t clear<br />
if he was safe or screamin&#8217;<br />
as he jabbed the bible flap<br />
he didn&#8217;t think to face the beast<br />
of profiteering that killed the priest<br />
colombia is bleeding</p>

<p>this is america</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard of Nellie McKay - thanks for the tip. Is that your own rewrite of her lyrics? Would have thought you would have given a link to Nellie&#8217;s original version, available at http://www.nelliemckay.net/lyrics_Columbia.html</p>
