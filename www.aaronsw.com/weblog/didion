<h1>The Journalist&#8217;s Creed</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not sure what more I could tell you about these pieces. I could tell you that I liked doing some of them more than others, but that all of them were hard for me to do, and took more time than perhaps they were worth; that there is always a point in the writing of a piece when I sit in a room literally papered with false starts and cannot put one word after another and imagine that I have suffered a small stroke, leaving me apparently undamaged but actually aphasic. I was in fact as sick as I had ever been when I was writing &#8220;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&#8221;; the pain kept me awake at night and so for twenty and twenty-one hours a day I drank gin-and-hot-water to blunt the pain and took Dexedrine to blunt the gin and wrote the piece. (I would like you to believe that I kept working out of some real professionalism, to meet the deadline, but that would not be entirely true; I did have a deadline, but it was also a troubled time, and working did to the trouble what gin did to the pain.) What else is there to tell? I am bad at interviewing people. I avoid situations in which I have to talk to anyone&#8217;s press agent. (This precludes doing pieces on most actors, a bonus in itself.) I do not like to make telephone calls, and would not like to count the mornings I have sat on some Best Western motel bed somewhere and tried to force myself to put through the call to the assistant district attorney. My only advantage as a reporter is that I am so physically small, so temperamentally unobtrusive, and so neurotically inarticulate that people tend to forget that my presence runs counter to their best interests. And it always does. That is one last thing to remember: <em>writers are always selling somebody out.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Joan Didion, <em>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</em>, xv-xvi)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact I have abandoned altogether that kind of pointless entry; instead I tell what some would call lies. &#8220;That&#8217;s simply not true,&#8221; the members of my family frequently tell me when they come up against my memory of a shared event. &#8220;The party was <em>not</em> for you, the spider was <em>not</em> a black widow, <em>it wasn&#8217;t that way at all</em>.&#8221; Very likely they are right, for not only have I always had trouble distinguishing between what happened and what merely might have happened, but I remain unconvinced that the distinction, for my purposes, matters. The cracked crab that I recall having for lunch the day my father came home from Detroit in 1945 must certainly be embroidery, worked into the day&#8217;s pattern to lend verisimilitude; I was ten years old and would not now remember the cracked crab. The day&#8217;s events did not turn on cracked crab. And yet it is precisely that fictitious crab that makes me see the afternoon all over again, a home movie run all too often, the father bearing gifts, the child weeping, an exercise in family love and guilt. Or that is what it was to me. Similarly, perhaps it never did snow that August in Vermont; perhaps there never were flurries in the night wind and maybe no one else felt the ground hardening and summer already dead even as we pretended to bask in it, but that was how it felt to me, and it might as well have snowed, could have snowed, did snow.</p>

<p>And it surely it did snow. I like to think that the world is what we make of it. That might be a bit daft, and it definitely even makes others come up with extreme perspectives. Such as the world being made of mint jelly. History goes hand-in-hand with the world. The kings, dates, battles of today and yesterday, yeah. They happened, but only to those who are sure it did (or not so sure).</p>
