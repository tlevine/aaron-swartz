<h1>djb</h1>

<p style="text-align: right"><a href="djb.ja">日本語</a></p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s time to remind people that D. J. Bernstein is the
greatest programmer in the history of the world.</p>

<p>First, look only at the objective facts. djb has written two major
pieces of system software: a mail server and a DNS server. Both are
run by millions of Internet domains. They accomplish all sorts of
complicated functions, work under incredibly high loads, and confront
no end of unusual situations. And they both run pretty much exactly
has Bernstein first wrote them. One bug &#8212; one bug! &#8212; was found in
qmail. A second bug was recently found in djbdns, but you can get a
sense of how important it is by the fact that it took people nearly a
decade to find it.</p>

<p>No other programmer has this kind of track record. Donald Knuth
probably comes closest, but his diary about writing TeX (printed in
<em><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0937073806">Literate Programming</a></em>)
shows how he kept finding bugs for years and never expected to be
finished, only to get closer and closer (thus the odd version
numbering scheme). Not only does no one else have djb&#8217;s track record,
no one else even comes close.</p>

<p>But far more important are the subjective factors. djb&#8217;s programs are
some of the greatest works of beauty to be comprehended by the human
mind. As with great art, the outline of the code is somehow visually
pleasing &#8212; there is balance and rhythm and meter that rivals even the
best typography. As with great poetry, every character counts &#8212; every
single one is there because it needs to be. But these programs are not
just for being seen or read &#8212; like a graceful dancer, they move! And
not just as a single dancer either, but a whole choreographed number
&#8212; processes splitting and moving and recombining at great speeds,
around and around again.</p>

<p>But, unlike a dance, this movement has a purpose. They accomplish
things that need accomplishing &#8212; they find your websites, they ferry
your email from place to place. In the most fantastic movies, the
routing and sorting of the post office is imagined as a giant endless
choreographed dance number. (Imagine, perhaps, &#8220;The Office&#8221; from
<em>Brazil</em>.) But this is no one-time fantasy, this is how your email
gets sorted <em>every day</em>.</p>

<p>And the dance is not just there to please human eyes &#8212; it is a dance
with a purpose. Each of its inner mechanisms is perfectly crafted,
using the fewest number of moving parts, accomplishing its task with
the most minimal energy. The way jobs are divided and assigned is
nothing short of brilliant. The brilliance is not merely linguistic,
although it is that too, but contains a kind of elegant mathematical
effectiveness, backed by a stream of numbers and equations that show,
through pure reason alone, that the movements are provably perfect, a
better solution is guaranteed not to exist.</p>

<p>But even all this does not capture his software&#8217;s incredible beauty.
For djb&#8217;s programs are not great machines to be admired from a
distance, vast powerhouses of elegant accomplishment. They are also
tools meant to be used by man, perfectly fitted to one&#8217;s hand. Like a
great piece of industrial design, they bring joy to the user every
time they are used.</p>

<p>What other field combines all these arts? Language, math, art, design,
function. Programming is clearly in a class of its own. And, when it
comes to programmers, who even competes with djb? Who else has worked
to realize these amazing possibilities? Who else even knows they are
there?</p>

<p>Oddly, there are many people who profess to hate djb. Some of this is
just the general distaste of genius: djb clearly has a forceful,
uncompromising vision, which many misinterpret as arrogance and
rudeness. And some of it is the practical man&#8217;s disregard for great
design: djb&#8217;s programs do not work like most programs, for the simple
reason that the way most programs work is wrong. But the animosity
goes much deeper than that. I do not profess to understand it, but I
do honestly suspect at some level it&#8217;s people without taste angry and
frustrated at the plaudits showered on what they cannot see. Great art
always generates its share of mocking detractors.</p>

<p>This is not to say that djb&#8217;s work is perfect. There are the bugs, as
mentioned before, and the log files, which are nothing if not
inelegant, and no doubt djb would make numerous changes were he to
write the software again today. But who else is even trying? Who else
even knows this is possible? I did not realize what great art in
software could be until I read djb. And now I feel dirty reading
anything else.</p>

<p>You have obviously never had to admin Qmail on a production system. You mention log files in passing, but this is a seriously issue when debugging issues (which there tends to be lots of).</p>

<p>Yes, there&#8217;s patches to get it to do useful things like logging, RBL lookups and LDAP authentucation. However by the time all that&#8217;s done, I&#8217;m pining for Postfix, or hell, even Sendmail&#8217;s M4 config.</p>

<p>From a coding and SMTP perspective, it might well be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I still break out in a sweat if asked to have a look at one of the Qmail servers on our network.</p>

<p>I agree with Aaron, and I ran qmail and djbdns on big production sites (as well as small personal ones) for more than a decade.</p>

<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve switched away from both of them&#8230;and from djb&#8217;s ezmlm.</p>

<p>I switched qmail to postfix, to test a theory that rejection-on-envelope might encourage the dictionary spammers to drop randomname@mydomain.tld from their lists (qmail can bounce or silently discard; bouncing is a waste of time and silent discards suggest that the address is valid, so it should be used again next time).  Yes, there are (or were) crufty patches to qmail for envelope rejection, but it just added to my growing feeling that no matter how great qmail was in 1996 (and most of history since then), email is now a rapidly changing environment, and qmail requires more active management than I am willing to commit.</p>

<p>I switched from ezmlm to mailman, which I don&#8217;t love, but I do appreciate the ability to offer a web interface that lets not-me manage the lists.</p>

<p>I switched from djbdns to nsd, which I am happy with.  I don&#8217;t like the zone file format (blame Vixie, I always do), or explicit serial numbers, but I do like simpler SRV records for jabber, etc.  I chose it because it isn&#8217;t BIND, the code is clean, it has a small footprint, and a few of the root servers run it.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who thinks this is a parody of DJB&#8217;s seemingly-constant attitude problem? I don&#8217;t know him personally, but almost everything I&#8217;ve ever read of his is surly. He is obviously talented, but he seems to suspect he might be the only one who is.</p>

<p>Can anyone find a link where he is excited, or happy, or whimsical?</p>

<p>I was a math major at UIC when djb was a newly minted Assistant Professor, and his personality could only be described as &#8220;relentlessly efficient.&#8221;  This comes through in his <a href="http://cr.yp.to/conferences/russia.html" rel="nofollow">Russian conference anecdote</a> just as well as in his code.  In person, he is actually quite cheerful, but he does not suffer foolishness gladly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d wager that many of the people above complaining about qmail and djbdns above do not remember what the Internet was like in 1993.  I am a reluctant Postfix user now, but I hate it, because I don&#8217;t understand it.  I defy anyone to create a <a href="https://www.milter.org/" rel="nofollow">milter</a>, for example, and claim that that is superior to djb&#8217;s more Unix-like design.</p>

<p>If you feel dirty when reading anything else, why didn&#8217;t you ever give me suggestions for improvement on my watchdog.net code? It&#8217;s not as if I didn&#8217;t request it. Or did you not read qmail until after that period?</p>

<p>I agree that the defect-free-ness of the qmail code is an impressive accomplishent, head and shoulders above any other production software I have heard of; and its minimalism is without peer in my experience. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the only axis of goodness in software, though. You might want to mention Curve25519, Bernstein v. United States, and his successful remote timing attack on software implementations of AES.</p>

<p>I thought this article was parody too, but the reason was that I&#8217;ve tried to look through djb&#8217;s code before and find it <em>utterly incomprehensible</em> in a way that I rarely find anyone else&#8217;s working code.  I can&#8217;t fathom what someone means when they describe it as aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>To sort this out, let&#8217;s start looking at some.  Here&#8217;s the main axfr function in djbdns, on google codesearch:</p>

<p>http://ur1.ca/dyas</p>

<p>There are almost no useful comments.  The function calls itself with slightly different arguments in order to accomplish different things, which is something that&#8217;s easy for computers to understand and very hard for humans to get their heads around.  The whole thing looks like it was designed for some almost mechanical &#8212; not virtual &#8212; machine and then hand-translated in C.  The &#8220;doit()&#8221; function is defined in several different files in the same source tree, so you can&#8217;t even refer to it by name unless you&#8217;re willing to say &#8220;no I mean the axfr doit() function not the tdlookup doit() function&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, please:  if there&#8217;s something to like about the aesthetic of this code, someone tell us what it is.  :)</p>

<p>Re: Chris Ball on axfr function</p>

<p>The function doesn&#8217;t call itself with slightly different arguments. There&#8217;s only one call to doit in that file and that&#8217;s from the main function.</p>

<p>djb uses main() to initialize things and then he usually has a doit() function to do the actual function of the program. There&#8217;s nothing confusing about it, not unless you find main() confusing as well.</p>

<p>I think Aaron&#8217;s post is a bit lofty, but djb is a true master.</p>
