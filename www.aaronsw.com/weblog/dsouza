<h1>The Enemy Too Close to Home</h1>

<p>How bizarre a book is <em>The Enemy At Home</em>, Dinesh D&#8217;Souza&#8217;s new screed insisting the left is responsible for Islamic extremism? Pretty bizarre. The book&#8217;s argument, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/books/06kaku.html?ex=1328418000&amp;en=8b6559c4b74d4d22&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">according to the <em>Times</em></a> is that &#8220;1) that the American left is allied to the Islamic radical movement to undermine the Bush White House and American foreign policy; and 2) that &#8216;the left is the primary reason for Islamic anti-Americanism&#8230;&#8217; because &#8216;liberals defend and promote values that are controversial in America and deeply revolting to people in traditional societies, especially in the Muslim world.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Follow that? The left is allies with Islamic extremists because the extremists hate the left. Just like Dinesh D&#8217;Souza. &#8220;[W]hen it comes to core beliefs,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;I&#8217;d have to confess that Iâ€™m closer to the dignified fellow in the long robe and prayer beads than to the slovenly fellow with the baseball cap [Michael Moore].&#8221;</p>

<p>In other words, it sounds like the right is allied with Islamic extremists in hating the liberal elements of American culture. What to do about this is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Does he think he&#8217;s the first one to realize that American religious extremists have plenty in common with foreign religious extremists? Isn&#8217;t that what Liberals have been shrieking since September 2001?</p>

<p>I guess he got a little thrown off by all his hatred. If you hate liberals, and you hate Islamic extremists, there has to be <em>something</em> linking them, right?</p>

<p>Taken to its logical conclusion, it reads like: If there are no more liberals in America, Islamic extremists won&#8217;t hate America. There will be no more terrorism and we can all live happily ever after.</p>

<p>This reminds me of ESR&#8217;s screeds of a few years back, before he fell off the radar. These reside somewhere on his blog, here: http://esr.ibiblio.org/</p>

<p>The islamic fundamentalist situation has to be utterly confounding to right wingers. Prior to 9-11, an accellerating meme was that Christians, Muslims, and Jews would bind together into a monotheistic conglomo-religion in opposition to godless liberalism. See &#8220;Peter Kreeft&#8221; for the best example of this. Also, it can&#8217;t help that the Bush familiy has longstanding ties to the Kingdom of Saud, who are major exporter of radical ismaili islam.</p>

<p>In reality both the islamic fundamentalist and the christian fundamentalist  seek to make religion the basis of secular power, and to subject democratic lawmaking to religious scrutiny and control.</p>

<p>Yes, after watching D&#8217;Souza on Colbert&#8217;s show, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s even worth reading reviews of the book.  His argument is truly wacky.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia does not export &#8220;Ismaili Islam&#8221; (whatever that is).  Ismailis are a tiny Shia off-shoot.</p>

<p>It is bizarre to think that american extremists are allied with any other extremists in the world. Extremists are trying to lead the majority of thier county into thier way of thinking. If they did not use religious they would use some thing else.</p>
