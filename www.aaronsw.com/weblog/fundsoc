<h1>The Fundamental Law of Sociology</h1>

<p>There are some loons on the Internet trying to spread the idea that the fundamental law of sociology is the black-white test score gap. Put aside the fact that anyone who would even think of proposing such an absurd thing must be a raving scientific racist.</p>

<p>And put aside the fact that they must also be fairly stupid, because such a claim is, at best, a discovery about a particular society, and not a law. (Can you imagine someone claiming that &#8220;falling objects accelerate at 32 feet per second per second&#8221; is a fundamental law of physics?)</p>

<p>Even put aside the fact that no actual sociologist would even go near such a claim, as the field&#8217;s entire purpose is to investigate <em>social</em> causes of such phenomena.</p>

<p>No, let us look at an actual fundamental law of sociology, the Thomas theorem. The Thomas theorem says &#8220;If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now think about what that means about claiming the black-white test score gap is an immutable law.</p>

<p>Assuming all people deserve to enjoy all the benefits of their innate worth, and assuming all people deserve to enjoy all benefits of their potential&#8230;</p>

<p>1) How do you best help them as an individual?</p>

<p>2) How do you best help them as a member of their social-economic group?</p>

<p>There are people who will not &#8220;sign up&#8221; to the simple framework outlined above for releasing positive human potential and engage in the implied consequent analysis and actions.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, they don&#8217;t wish to &#8220;sign up&#8221;.</p>

<p>I am inclined to treat those people as brain damaged.  Speak to them slowly, make no sudden movements, place their wallets inside of their mouths lest they choke on their own tongues.</p>

<p>In other words, if I come across a &#8220;socio-economist&#8221; sunk into a trough of pig filth, I trod upon his head to keep my pant cuffs from becoming soiled, and continue walking along.  I don&#8217;t stick around to listen to his gurglings.</p>

<p>Esp since &#8220;feet per second&#8221; isn&#8217;t a measure of acceleration :)</p>

<p>I would have liked to ask for links to the sources - who could possibly claim anything like that, except for real racist nutters. But they don&#8217;t deserve an upgrade to their page-rank by being linked from here&#8230;</p>

<p>He might be talking about that Steve Sailer jackass that was harassing Malcolm Gladwell in his blog comments. That&#8217;s the only person that leaped to mind for me, although it never would have occurred to me to call Steve Sailer a sociologist. But there is a never ending supply of other racists that aaronsw might be talking about.</p>

<p>Is it possible this is satire?  Don&#8217;t shoot; this is the first time I&#8217;ve heard it and it sounds too silly to be honest.</p>

<p>What would we do without people to tell us what we should and should not think of proposing?  Bravo, Aaron.</p>

<p>Pseudonymous statistician La Griffe du Lion invented the meme that the black-white IQ gap is the Fundamental Law of Sociology.  Here&#8217;s its first appearance:</p>

<p>Aaron&#8217;s criticisms are dead on, IMO - calling this the fundamental law of sociology is absurd.</p>

<p>But the pesky IQ gap is real enough.</p>
