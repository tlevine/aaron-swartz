<h1>Getting It Right</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s an interesting little experiment you can do. If you have a classroom of kids and you give them a bunch of tasks they can work on of varying difficulty, the kids will pick the tasks that are just outside their level, that stretch them to do a little bit more. (This is, of course, if they aren&#8217;t getting graded on this. If they&#8217;re getting graded, they&#8217;ll always pick the easy ones.)</p>

<p>When I first heard about this experiment, I just assumed it was because they were good kids. But now I think there&#8217;s a different explanation. It&#8217;s because doing this is fun.</p>

<p>Working on something that&#8217;s too easy for you isn&#8217;t enjoyable, it&#8217;s just mindless. (There&#8217;s a reason few people play <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/50K_Racewalker">50K Racewalker</a>.) But doing something that&#8217;s too hard for you isn&#8217;t fun either. It&#8217;s just like trying to run through a wall: you&#8217;re not going to succeed and you&#8217;re not going to learn much from it. So, like Goldilocks, the kids pick the task that&#8217;s just right.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not simply by default either. There&#8217;s something actively enjoyable in itself about learning to achieve more. (I&#8217;ve <a href="easywayout">come to call this</a> the &#8220;Kipper effect&#8221;, after the novel Kipper&#8217;s Game which revolves around this idea.) There&#8217;s a definite high to achievement, the rush of accomplishment, just as there&#8217;s a corresponding low when you fail.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking for more research on this idea &#8212; and I&#8217;d be very grateful if anyone could point me to it. What kinds of things trigger the Kipper effect? Does it wear off? etc.</p>

<p>You should definitely read &#8220;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience&#8221; by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, which talks about the state of flow - Zen-like state which occurs when balance is found between the challenge of the task and the skill of the performer.</p>

<p>Kathy Sierra talks about this a lot, only she focuses mostly on the context of software users instead of students. But she&#8217;s done a lot of reading and writing about keeping people interested by keeping things slightly challenging. So she could probably recommend some good research on the topic.</p>

<p>Alan Kay wrote that he likes to challenge kids to &#8216;write (type?)&#8217; because it&#8217;s bit difficult thing to do. He wrote he basically sets that his basic setting (for Dynabook/Squeak) is - to challenge&#8217; kids to do something bit more difficult or we humans are not innately equipped to do fluently or elegantly.</p>

<p>So there might be some papers or references he and his people (SmallTalkers,Squeakers?) can suggest - how to set hoops or hardles in front of kids - they&#8217;ve been doing this for decades&#8230;they also (almost?) say kids have more talents in science and math than parents or teachers. [I am not very clear about how they put these two different things in one.]</p>

<p>As you may know he is basically in the same camp? as Seymour Papert, who takes bit more looser articulations about kids&#8217; talents or potentials and how our regular education systems are not matching. (and wasting so many kids&#8230;)</p>

<p>I now think those IA people (Intelligence Augmentation) should have written a lot more about education settings and kids - in the modern world. They could have written a lot more as general analysis, findings, and criticisms or suggestions - about education. That could have cleared up many issues. By merely writing or talking as computer scientists, they kind of really didn&#8217;t fill the lines they had to fill. There is still some time left - while they are alive - but I am not sure how much they&#8217;d come to succeed on popularizing their ideals and dreams - and softwares (and hardwares?).</p>

<p>On a different note, there is an very old Stanford book, History of Education, written by Cubberley? might be an interesing reference book to have around for your - seems - interest in education system&#8217;s settings. Recently someone wrote a book about that book, but I haven&#8217;t checked up.</p>

<p>Michael Oakeshott?&#8217;s book titled &#8216;On Human Conduct&#8217; has - pp350 or so around? (there are different editions probably) - a brief paragraphs about the origins of modern educations. (It&#8217;s for &#8216;Nations&#8217; to build meritocracies&#8230;to beat each other up&#8230;)</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m still probably very clueless about the history of &#8216;Universities&#8217; - and &#8216;kids&#8217; in the West. When peer pressure thing came in, when drinking and drugs became common, &#8216;who&#8217; started to sell those things to kids, - or kids themselves started by themselves(because they are so happy being away from suburbs and parents?).</p>

<p>Yeah, Aaron, you should definitely check out Flow, the book Nikita recommended.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll learn more about the so-called Kipper Effect.  According to Csikszentmihalyi&#8217;s research, it&#8217;s one of the core components of flow &#8212; you need to be stretched just outside of your comfort zone.</p>
