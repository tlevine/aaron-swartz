<h1>Lazy Backup</h1>

<p>If there&#8217;s one thing good UI designers know, it&#8217;s that the best UI is not to have one at all. Applications should just save, security should just work, and computers should just backup.</p>

<p>Apparently that last task is a harder than it appears, since I still haven&#8217;t found decent backup software for Unix (OS X and GNU/Linux).</p>

<p>Here is how the software should work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I install it.</p></li>
<li><p>I point it at some storage server (ideally Amazon EC2 and S3, but if that&#8217;s too hard then a GNU/Linux server with a large drive).</p></li>
<li><p>I give it a maximum space limit (e.g. store no more than 200GB).</p></li>
<li><p>I give it a maximum up-bandwidth limit (e.g. use no more than 5K/s).</p></li>
<li><p>I tell it to run.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>From then on, it should just work. In the background, it will upload my files to the server using only 5K/s of bandwidth. If I get disconnected from the Internet or reboot my computer, when I get back on it will pick up where it left off. If a file changes it will only send the diff and store that as well. When I run out of disk space it will delete the old diffs.</p>

<p>It will preserve all the Unix ACLs and permissions and weird Mac OS X resource forks and stuff so that if my drive ever dies I can make a full bootable restore from the backup.</p>

<p>Does this software exist?</p>

<p>The closest I&#8217;ve seen is <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/">rdiff-backup</a>, which is very nice but fails to automate some key steps.</p>

<p>If it doesn&#8217;t exist, let me know if you&#8217;re interested in writing it (a wrapper around <code>rdiff-backup</code> to do it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard, I would think). I&#8217;d be willing to offer a bounty.</p>

<p>I like Deja Vu (which comes bundled with Toast). I just schedule daily backups to my server and forget about it. It&#8217;s completely faceless and just backs up my home folder without bothering me as long as I have my server volume mounted (which I always do anyway).</p>

<p>rsync can do pretty much everything you ask for (although I&#8217;m not sure if it can handle the MacOS stuff unless it&#8217;s stored in a regular file).  I have a setup where everything you mention is in place except for the bandwidth and disk space limitations (okay, it uses rsync over ssh and cron to schedule the jobs).  rsync does support a bandwidth limit option, and with du, another cron job can go through and clear out old backups.</p>

<p>Are you looking for something that will upload your files <em>as you save them</em>, or using a nightly cron or similar?  It would be really nice if it could detect when files were modified, instead of having to scan your entire filesystem for changes (which purportedly Time Machine will be able to do, but it looks limited in other ways).</p>

<p>On my last machine, I used rsnapshot. It makes incremental backups, and handles scheduling for you, which is nice. Also, you don&#8217;t need any special tools to restore the backups.</p>

<p>But I have just switched to a macbook. As it happens, my new backup drives arrived in the mail this very afternoon. I think I&#8217;ll give rdiff-backup a try.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#8217;m pretty interested in your bounty. I wonder if I can find the time. It&#8217;d be great if you provided more details about what exactly you wanted.</p>

<p>You may wish to consider pull backups &#8212; where the backup server periodically connects to the source and downloads the data for backup, rather than the client explicitly uploading.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the client has read/write access to the backup medium, an attacker, worm or user/software error on your machine would be able to damage or tamper with your backups.</p>

<p>The ideal solution that I&#8217;ve been thinking about is a &#8216;backup appliance&#8217; &#8212; a simple unattended machine that will periodically connect to my primary data store(s) and take an incremental snapshot, ideally via rsync-over-SSH.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard &#8212; Linksys NSLU2 devices already seem to provide most of my desired functionality, with configuration via HTTP and support for backing up SMB shares.  (They&#8217;re embedded Linux machines, and can be reinstalled with more general-purpose firmware, eg from http://www.nslu2-linux.org/)</p>

<p>Multiple backup appliance instances could be deployed (in different physical locations) for added redundancy.</p>

<p>In the case of a laptop as the source, one issue would be host discovery and connectivity - if the laptop is on a non-routable IP address or inbound port 22 connections aren&#8217;t available (which is common), then the backup appliances may have problems connecting.  Some kind of backwards SSH tunnelling would probably solve this problem.</p>

<p>Similarly, bandwidth on the client may vary &#8212; some mechanism to moderate the bandwidth used by the backup appliances from the client-side would be desirable.</p>

<p>But I haven&#8217;t built it yet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using rsyncbackup (http://rsyncbackup.erlang.no/) for about 2 years on a mac.</p>

<p>It will work over a network (since it&#8217;s rsync under the hood).</p>

<p>I personaly use it on a local volume since it can handle incremental backups quite well using hard links.</p>

<p>As for the space limit problem, there is no good solution, but you always can delete older backups in a cron job.</p>

<p>You MUST, AND I MEAN MUST use incremental backups. Having just one copy is completely useless as a corrupted file is gone forever. Likewise for an accidentally deleted one, when you discover the problem after a backup.</p>

<p>Use a linux based solution that can do it via hard-links. This means you can cd into each directory and see a copy of the full set, without  it taking up lots of space for the same data. For this reason I have been using RIBS (RSync Incremental Backups) for several years now. I have a copy of my home directory available going back three years or so.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t have a GUI, but you do need to edit the script to set the directory to backup, and the host to SSH to in order to do the backup. Not complicated. Oh, and you need to set up cron to perform backups.</p>

<p>It will pickup from where it left off if disturbed, and it will also only transfer over the changes. I use it to backup a 120gig primary storage area every single night, consisting of files averaging from a few kilobytes up to several hundred meg.</p>

<p>A general purpose bandwidth limiter would make an interesting general application / utility.  So many apps need network connectivity, I&#8217;m imagining a tool that would let me define up/down limits for specific applications and forget about it.  At home we&#8217;re on dialup and winXP, being able to limit everything but firefox (i.e. keep all the auto update checkers from getting in the way) would be huge.</p>

<p>Reading the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix05/tech/freenix/full_papers/eriksen/eriksen_html/index.html" rel="nofollow">trickle paper</a> makes it sound like a general solution would be non-trivial.  It may be easier to make something like a modified firewall and send the backup out over a specific port every time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) for a couple years with no problems.  It runs on Windows, Linux and OS X.</p>

<p>The great thing about it is that it does masterless replication, so I can create files on any machine and the rest of the machines eventually get them. Of course, that&#8217;s the downside, since you can&#8217;t really just let it run and forget about it since you have to manually deal with merge conflicts (pretty rare in practice). You might be able to set up a cron job and have it skip conflicts, I haven&#8217;t tried that.</p>

<p>Its a commercial app in beta, but this app is a &#8220;set and forget&#8221; app that only copies the changed bytes (similar to Rsync) and encrypts the data on your machine before uploading it.  I have an interested in this, so I am certainly not impartial:</p>

<p>On another note though, I have used Rsync for a long time on the Mac. Its a great tool. My only issue was that my data was not encrypted at the server end, so thats why we decided to write our own. Its only in beta and available for Mac and Windows, so appreciate any feedback</p>

<p>Try looking at ZFS:</p>

<p>http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/</p>

<p>&#8220;ZFS backup and restore are powered by snapshots. Any snapshot can generate a full backup, and any pair of snapshots can generate an incremental backup. Incremental backups are so efficient that they can be used for remote replication — e.g. to transmit an incremental update every 10 seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Snapshots are just one of many nice features ZFS offers.  That said, it&#8217;d take some serious work to get it working on your Mac, assuming it&#8217;s possible at all.</p>

<p>Aaron,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s commercial software, but Storage Exec from Veritas/Symantec does file level replication between a source and target share/file system.  It can throttle CPU and bandwidth utilization.</p>

<p>BackupExec with Continuouse Data Protection has a similar functionality, with an agent.</p>

<p>Your data is most important, but the ability to perform a fast, reliable recovery of a system is critical for business use.  For this purpose, I bought Acronis when my daughter went to college with her laptop.  It creates a boot CD (linux based) that allows network and USB connections to restore an image to the machine.  Backup rates are ~1 Gig/min for USB 2.  Restores are a bit longer, but they are 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Echoing a theme from previous posts, Acronis supports an incremental backup feature and you can schedule using the Acronis scheduler.</p>

It has a &#8220;director&#8221; on one (Linux) machine and you schedule it to connect to the other machines and do incremental backups onto another storage machine or backup device.

<p>I&#8217;m surprised nobody has mentioned backuppc (http://backuppc.sourceforge.net). It pulls backups down through the network, does incremental backups, and even pools files across PCs, so that only one copy of any given file is stored in the backup.

<p>Nice web interface for restoring backups, automatic notification mails if it&#8217;s unable to do a backup for an extended period of time, only backs up machines after work hours if they&#8217;re constantly online&#8212;but if they&#8217;re not, will pick up where it left off as soon as it sees a machine that has been offline&#8230;</p>

<p>It copies using Rsync or Samba, so it&#8217;ll backup Windows, too, if you need it to&#8230; I have it running on a 10 year old dual 500MHz server that can&#8217;t really be used for anything else&#8230;</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t figured out how to cap its size/bandwidth, but I find it incredibly easy to (not) use, and have even used it to restore files for clients with a few clicks&#8230;</p>

<p>CrashPlan might come close to what you&#8217;re looking for (Mac OS X). You point it to a server, give it an amount of bandwidth to use, and tell it to go, and it backs up most recent changes first and then the rest of your stuff. When files change, it does a diff and only backs up the bytes that have changed, since bandwidth is a bottleneck. Here&#8217;s a review at TidBITS:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crashplan.com/" rel="nofollow">CrashPlan</a> isn&#8217;t just for Mac OS X&#8230; it runs on Linux and Windows also (actually, Linux is &#8220;coming soon&#8221;)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently looking into backup programs as I want to backup a Mac and a Windows laptop to an NSLU2 running Debian Linux.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fluffy.co.uk/boxbackup/" rel="nofollow">Boxbackup</a> sounds like it does what you want (although I&#8217;m not sure about the bandwidth limiting). It claims to support Mac OS resource forks, although I&#8217;ve not tried this yet. A &lt;a href=http://blog.plasticsfuture.org/2006/04/23/mac-backup-software-harmful/&#8221;>blog post on Mac backups</p> put the fear into me about correct handling of the Mac&#8217;s mess of metadata. I&#8217;d love to see the guy&#8217;s set of torture test files for backup tools.

<p>rdiff-backup was horribly slow for me: it took about an hour for an incremental backup to decide to do more or less nothing. I&#8217;m not sure whether that&#8217;s because the NSLU2 is slow and the comparisons are being done on the server side, or what. I&#8217;m going to look into Bacula and Boxbackup when I get a moment. Bacula isn&#8217;t the sort of lazy backup you talk of, but seems to be well maintained and used by serious sysadmins, so I&#8217;m inclined to trust it over the various rsync based scripts which are out there.</p>
