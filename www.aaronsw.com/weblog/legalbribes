<h1>Public Service Announcement</h1>

<p>These are sad days for American democracy. Ohio congressman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ney#Controversies">Bob Ney</a> took bribes of tens of thousands of dollars in contributions and gifts. California congressman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Cunningham#Plea_agreement">Duke Cunningham</a> is in jail after forfeiting $1.8 million in bribes. And Louisiana congressman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Jefferson">William Jefferson</a> is giving up $1 million in bribes after <a href="http://harpers.org/sb-williamjefferson-21-9384239.html">an FBI raid on his house found $90,000 in a freezer</a>.</p>

<p>In these days of widespread corruption and bribery, it is important to remember that no, this is not how our great democracy is supposed to work. The bribery is supposed to be <a href="001458">much more subtle</a> &#8212; not to mention legal.</p>

<p>Such bribery (overt or not) wouldn&#8217;t be worth a dime if it didn&#8217;t go both ways &#8212; politicians bribe us, too.  Considering the trillions of dollars they hold sway over, I&#8217;m surprised the amounts we&#8217;re talking about are so small.</p>

<p>About the only way to reduce (and perhaps eliminate) these bribes (both to the elected officials and from them to special interests or the general population) is by reducing the scope of government to that envisioned in the Constitution.  If the federal government budget were say 0.1% of what it is today there would be much less influence peddling.  For more on this, read Harry Browne&#8217;s <em>Why Government Doesn&#8217;t Work</em> (http://www.libertyfree.com/WGDW/Chapter6.htm - sample chapter).</p>
