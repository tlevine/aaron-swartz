<h1>Cooling the Mark Out</h1>

<p>You run into a man at a party. You strike up a conversation. He seems
very friendly. You like him. And then he tells you about some friends he
has. This man is called the roper.</p>

<p>The friends tell you about a deal. They know about a gamble, but it&#8217;s
rigged so you can&#8217;t lose. Just give them some money and they&#8217;ll show
you. This is called the con.</p>

<p>The first time you give them money it works; it comes back ten-fold. But
now you&#8217;re getting greedy. You want to do it again, bigger this time.
Only this time their money doesn&#8217;t come back. This is called the loss.</p>

<p>You feel like a chump. Your greediness got the best of you. You want to
get back at those con-men. You are called the mark.</p>

<p>But the roper talks you down.  You can&#8217;t go to the police without
admitting that you were trying to commit a crime. And everybody has to
lose sometime, right? It could be worse. This is called cooling out the
mark.</p>

<p>Erving Goffman, the great sociologist, <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~algazi/mat/Goffman--Cooling.htm">noticed this decades ago</a>. Only he
didn&#8217;t just notice it in con men. Students had to be persuaded to accept
a world far less idealistic than they learned in school.  Kids who
failed the bar exam had to persuade themselves they didn&#8217;t really want
to be lawyers. People at restaurants had to be persuaded to accept the
screwup by the kitchen. Everyone occasionally needs &#8220;schooling in the
philosophy of taking a loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this last example that particularly struck me. The other day,  I
was watching <a href="http://www.customersarealways.com/2007/03/lessons_from_james_arthur_ray.html">a video clip of a motivational speaker</a>. And what did he
talk about? A screwup by a restaurant he went to. And how the host
worked hard, overhard even, to pacify him about it.</p>

<p>It was a decent story. It was very well told. But why was a motivational
speaker telling it? But now I realize: it was about cooling out the
mark.</p>

<p>Cooling out marks is how institutions persuade people to accept things
they think are wrong. The con-man convinces you getting stolen from is
OK. Your job convinces you it&#8217;s OK that they&#8217;re corrupt. The restaurant
persuades you it&#8217;s OK that they&#8217;re incompetent.</p>

<p>Motivational speakers do the same thing. Did the economy cheat you,
fire you, stick you in some crappy job with a crabby boss? Listen, the
motivational speaker explains, it&#8217;s not the economy&#8217;s fault. And just as
the roper is always separate from the con men, the motivational speaker
doesn&#8217;t directly work for the economy. He sits on the sidelines, waiting
to cool the mark out.</p>
