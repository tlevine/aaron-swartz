<h1>The New McCarthy: Bill O&#8217;Reilly</h1>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="static/oreilly" alt="Bill O'Reilly" /><img src="static/mccarthy" alt="Joe McCarthy" /></p>

<p>I was reading <a href="http://chron.edgecity.net/story/2004/3/15/9333/53123">an old transcript of a piece about Joe McCarthy</a>&#8217;s anti-communist witchunt hearings and I was surprised to find that some of his comments sounded awfully familiar. I did a little googling, and I think I figured out why:</p>

<p>MCCARTHY: A few days ago I read that President Eisenhower expressed the hope that by election time in 1954 the subject of Communism would be a dead and forgotten issue. The raw, harsh unpleasant fact is that Communism is an issue and will be an issue in 1954.</p>

<p>TONY SNOW (sitting in for O&#8217;Reilly): This morning, the president pounced on a quote in Sunday&#8217;s New York Times Magazine where Senator Kerry called terrorists a nuisance. (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200410130005">October 10, 2004</a>)</p>

<p>MCCARTHY: You know the [American] Civil Liberties Union has been listed as &#8220;a front for, and doing the work of,&#8221; the Communist Party?</p>

<p>OREILLY: [T]here is no question the ACLU and the judges who side with them are terror allies. (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200507260002">July 25, 2005</a>)</p>

<p>MCCARTHY: Now, you wrote a book in 1932. I&#8217;m going to ask you again: at the time you wrote this book, did you feel that professors should be given the right to teach sophomores that marriage &#8212; and I quote &#8212; &#8220;should be cast out of our civilization as antiquated and stupid religious phenomena?&#8221; Was that your feeling at that time?</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: You can understand how people like me and maybe a lot of people watching think you are a loony lefty when your book, <em>Fanatics &amp; Fools</em> [&#8230;] is endorsed by the following: Molly Ivins; Bill Maher, Bill Moyers; and Larry David. Why don&#8217;t you get Che Guevara on that, oh, he&#8217;s dead. How about Fidel Castro? Come on, they are the far left fringe. That&#8217;s who you&#8217;re hanging with &#8230; (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200404210002">April 20, 2004</a>)</p>

<p>MCCARTHY: If a stupid, arrogant or witless man in a position of power appears before our Committee and is found aiding the Communist Party, he will be exposed. The fact that he might be a General places him in no special class as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>OREILLY: The only thing we can do is hold people who raise and give money to the ACLU accountable. In the weeks to come, The Factor will tell you who these people and organizations are, so you can decide whether or not you want to do business with them. (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164837,00.html">August 5, 2005</a>)</p>

<p>MCCARTHY: When the shouting and the tumult dies, the American people and the President will realize that this unprecedented mud slinging against the Committee by the extreme left wing elements of press and radio was caused solely because another Fifth Amendment Communist was finally dug out of the dark recesses and exposed to the public view.</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: Enter Hillary Clinton, who wants to sit in the White House. In her Newsweek column this week, liberal Anna Quindlen gushes over Mrs. Clinton, describing her as a moderate. &#8230; That&#8217;s what I mean about the left-wing media. To them, social issues like unfettered abortion, pro-gay instruction in public schools &#8230; [are] tak[en] for granted.

<p>You&#8217;re even closer than you know.</p>

<p>http://mccarthy.vg/article.pl?sid=05/10/04/1523242</p>

<p>In 1944, German troops stood American POWs in a field and machine-gunned them. In 1946 the perpetrators were caught, put on trial, and mostly sentenced to death (though no executions were ever carried out). In 1949, Sen. Joe McCarthy started pimping the line that the SS killers were innocent, it was a sham trial, they were tortured into confessing, and so on.</p>

<p>Last week Bill O&#8217;Reilly, in what can be most charitably described as a colossal brain-fart, claimed that the massacre was in fact committed by the U.S. Army, 82nd Airborne Division.</p>

<p>Since O&#8217;Reilly has written more sensibly about the Malmedy massacre elsewhere, I suspect that he simply forgot the details of the event and in his fervor just assumed that the U.S. Army was responsible for this war crime. His point was that since the U.S. military committed war crimes over and over in the past, it&#8217;s no big deal now. What would be interesting is to see Noam Chomsky debate Bill O&#8217;Reilly, with the topic: &#8220;Resolved: that the U.S. military constantly commits war crimes.&#8221; We might get them to agree! At which point, one by one, the stars would go out.</p>

<p>Your point is&#8230;.?</p>

<p>In what way do the paranoid rantings of a blowhard right wing tv commentator compare to the threat represented by a US senator with subpoena power?</p>

<p>As for Chomsky, his paranoid rantings are no less offensive than O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s except that they are more interesting due to the magnitude of the intellectual resources he brings to the discussion. I wish he had stuck to generative grammar.</p>

<p>You useful idiots have such cute little McCarthy anecdotes, plucked directly from the dumpsters of COMMUNIST disinfo, distorted disinfo that so effectively marginalized him.  If you took the time to research what McCarthy actually said, instead of relying on the brainwashing soundbites so carefully provided for your easy consumption, you would discover that most of what he  claimed was actually true.  That&#8217;s OK cause the chains being prepared for you will be custom fitted, so that you&#8217;ll hardly notice them at all.</p>

The Zionist media has brilliantly demonized McCarthy, a true patriot, who tried (but failed) to wake the country up to the infestation and corruption of jews in our country.  O&#8217;Reilly is one ot their shills.  If McCarthy were around today,  O&#8217;Reilly would call him a terrorist, aiding the enemy, blah blah.

<p>Anyone who thinks McCarthy was an anti-communist HAS fallen for the communist disinformation. Trotsky&#8217;s red army was financed by J.P. Morgan. General Electric built the Soviet power grid from 1921-23. Ford Motor company technology established the Kama River truck plant that fabricated much of the hardware used against U.S. troops in Korea and Vietnam.</p>

<p>NONE of these organizations or the elites that ran them were ever fingered by McCarthy. His job was to convey a sense of fear and mistrust among the rank and file that was conducive as an excuse to expand government power over the people. The real purveyors of communism, the Fabian Socialists of the Council of Foreign Relations, they now practically OWN the government, media and industry in this country.</p>

<p>THAT is the legacy of Joe McCarthy. He distracted the people with a freakish sideshow while the real enemies crept in the back door and took over. He performed his job admirably for his collectivist, elitist masters.</p>

And he was married with kids at the time.  Just goes to show that these Christian, holier-than-thou, more-honorable-than-thou shills are just wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing, and Christianity/Republicanism makes the pefect sheep&#8217;s clothing, so no wonder it attracts so many rabid wolves.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the crux of the thing:  McCarthy was partly right, I think.  His METHODS were the problem.  True, Bill O&#8217;Reilly has no power of supena, but he holds a much higher chair in the ever-problematic &#8220;Court of Public Opinion&#8221;  Which is much harder to sway out of it&#8217;s concrete boots.</p>

<p>These people, O&#8217;Reilly, McCarthy are what I call Fixers.  People who think they are pulling the strings behind the scenes to &#8220;Fix&#8221; things to be the way they want them.  They are partly right.  They have power swinging around to the point of being dangerous.  But, these fixers don&#8217;t realize the backswell that happens to gather behind them.  Eventually, a levee breaks (with apologies to Louisiana) or an Edward R. Murrow comes along&#8230;.. we just need it to happen now!</p>

<p>All O&#8217;Reilly is, is a talking head entertainer in the guise of serious political commentator.</p>

<p>Time, events, and recent revelations (Venona Intercepts, released Russian documents) show that McCarthy was basically right about Moscow-loyal communists infiltrating the centers of power in this country. So he outted some Hollywood liberal commies, whose loyalty was not to this country, thereby ending their careers. Nothing wrong with that IMO.</p>
