<h1>Pay it Forward</h1>

<p>A year or two ago, I suffered from a devastating server crash. The little &#8220;heads&#8221; that read data off the hard drive crashed into the driv itself, and as we rebooted the computer, trying to get it working again, they scratched the hard drive so badly that when we sent it to try to get it repaired we learned  they had scraped the drive straight through.</p>

<p>My site was dead, my backups weren&#8217;t working, an entire year of my work had been lost and I was devastated. A bunch of generous souls chipped in an amazing $4000 to my server fund to try to bring things back.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;m back on my feet, I&#8217;d like tor eturn the favor by donating $4000 to websites in trouble. (Indeed, I&#8217;ve been planning this for a while and have already donated some to sites when I heard they were having fundraising drives.) 
So here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s Sunday Bonus Post: suggest a site that deserves a donation. Here are the rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The site must publish content or provide a service on the Internet.</p></li>
<li><p>The site must have a donate button or some other explicit request for donations.</p></li>
<li><p>You must genuinely like the site.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to nominate a site that meets these criteria, post it here in a comment. I&#8217;ll try to make most of the donations by next week.</p>

<p>I agree with the idea. But I think you can do most or more by making backup.reddit (where people talk about backup issues - history and solutions) - subreddit site, so that now this widespread PC and digital equipment use among &#8216;not that informed or ready&#8217; populations all over the planet gets some - reasonable helps and guides.</p>

<p>That subreddit can have a policy of (comfortably) accepting people&#8217;s own writings and ideas about backup (and may be some security) issues. It can encompass issues like &#8216;Why we still can&#8217;t disable &#8216;Don&#8217;t save&#8217; button? for some sloppy people or with disabilities.&#8217; &#8216;OLPC would have backup solutions for those kids personal unique data?&#8217; &#8216;How Amazon S3&#8217;s backup potential can be a start of real infra for off-premise backups for personal computation, finally?&#8217;. etc.</p>

<p>That&#8217;d have some lasting effect and results.</p>

<p>You may want to consider increasing your donation by  50% or 100%.  Thus creating a sort of Ponzi scheme for donations should the people you donate to decide to repay it similarly.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the best torrent site ever. I download almost every book there to check out if it&#8217;s worth buying in deadtree format, not to mention having a softcopy to search through helps. They also have tv shows (old obscure ones and new ones) et al.I am unsure what you stand on that is&#8230;</p>

<p>They do have a donate page (www.demonoid.com/donate.php)but it seems you have to be registered to donate so I&#8217;ll send you an invite when they open again or if you want I can email you my username and password temporarily.</p>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, a donation from my account would cause me to have my ratio autocomplete to 1. As it is, my ratio stands at 0.96 right now and I strive to keep it at 1 by not leeching.</p>

<p>I recommend <a href="http://newstandardnews.net/" rel="nofollow">The New Standard</a>, an independent hard news site which has been struggling for attention and funds. They don&#8217;t accept advertising of any sort. They almost went under this fall, but just squeaked through on their fundraising drive. Noam Chomsky once offered to triple anyone&#8217;s donation.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re a serious outfit doing the type of news that many of us on the left consider important, while still setting a standard for reporting that even corporate news sites should aspire to. They report mostly on topics that corporate media would never touch. I&#8217;ve been a fan since they began running reports from the ground in Iraq from the excellent correspondent, Dahr Jamail, at the start of the war when virtually all journalists were embedded within the military or otherwise confined to safe areas. I also enjoy their coverage of worker rights issues and the environment. For those of us who hope for a world with more reputable, independent media organizations, this looks to be one of the best sites to root for.</p>

<p>Hey Aaron, 
I think I might have found someone that I believe should get some help with his website. CJNepal.org (http://cjnepal.org) is a Nepal citizen journalism website. &#8220;We still believe that every citizen has the right to speak up their mind and participate to inform the society&#8221;. That&#8217;s what it is all about. Trying to get rid of the &#8220;censorship&#8221; which is common in Nepal. Prameya, the site owner, is a friend of mine, and has a dream he really wants to accomplish; to have his website noticed all over Nepal. He started his project when he was still living in Nepal, which was called Merosansar. After he received a death threat from the king of Nepal (Yes, really! He&#8217;s a dictator, you might have heard about revolts in Nepal on the news not that long ago), he was forced to close his site and moved to New York with his family where he&#8217;s now a student at Syracuse University. So, a few months ago, he started his site again under a new name, CJNepal. Also, Prameya needs to pay for his server, for advertising, hiring Nepali people who&#8217;d like to write articles for the site, etc. No wonder he&#8217;s currently in debt, so any money would really help him out I guess. If you would ever feel like donating to CJNepal, you can find a donate button on the About page here: http://cjnepal.org/node/78
Also, would you mind including my name (Laurent) on the additional Note form when donating (if you ever would), just because I&#8217;d like to thank him for all the things he has done for me.</p>

<p>Hello Aaron,
I would like to nominate to you &#8220;Modest Needs&#8221; at http://www.modestneeds.org &#8212;- for your plan to &#8220;pay it forward&#8221; the help you received. Modest Needs is a non-profit organization who helps people with a one time need such as a mother whose husband has left her with all the bills and her electricity is about to be turned off; or someone who was affected by Hurricane Katrina and needs money to buy more lumber or other supplies to help re-build their home. You can browse the applications the site receives from people asking for help and see the struggles each person is facing and requesting a little help. Modest Needs has been helping people for over 5 years, I believe, with &#8220;modest requests&#8221;. The President of Modest Needs who began the program with his own money will be on the Today Show Saturday Morning, November 18, 2006 talking about how the program works. Donors from all over the world give contributions, either every month or on a one-time basis. These funds are then used to give away to the neediest of people applying. They do thorough checks to verify all information submitted to them by the people requesting help through their site, and it has been heartwarming for me to be a donor with this organization. Most donations, like mine of usually $30 per month, doesn&#8217;t make a huge difference, but when many people get together and give $5, $10, $30 or even $4,000, it makes a huge difference in many people&#8217;s lives.</p>

<p>It cost nothing to register at their site. I hope you will take a look and see the amazing things going on there when people like me and many others get together and &#8216;pay it forward&#8217;. I&#8217;m not one of the administrators of the program, only a donor who believes in what they are doing. I think you will find many awesome stories of help given demonstrated through Modest Needs.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, Dr. Keith Taylor is the President of Modest Needs and his contact information is on the site. Thank you for your consideration of this organization as you decide how to pay forward the help you received.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Bonnie B.</p>

<p>Okay, since someone already mentioned fsf, here are others I wanted to mention. Note: my criteria is the ratio between the importance of the project and the money given to it, not the technical opinion.

I mentioning the projects I consider vital, but that aren&#8217;t receiving much attention:</p>

It&#8217;s a convenient notepad application that integrates into your Google Homepage. There are a few thousand regular users (i.e. who update their notes at least every couple of days), and our server got overloaded just before Thanksgiving. About a loooong week of downtime and many frustrated emails from users, things are back online.</p>

<p>Google Notes was first released in January and we only recently began accepting donations in the hopes of maintaining a high quality of service.</p>

<p>I nominate gmane.org, an archive of zillions of mailing lists that you can read via nntp or a web browser. A request for donations is at http://gmane.org/faq.php (the &#8220;hardware&#8221; question).</p>
