<h1>RSS Hits the Big Time</h1>

<p>As <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sunlightlabs/browse_thread/thread/dfd9fd76be9b6f1b">chaunceyt pointed out</a>, the new stimulus bill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/files/Initial%20Recovery%20Act%20Implementing%20Guidance.pdf">implementation instructions</a> require that each government agency report the money it gives out in RSS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each of the near term reporting requirements (major communications, formula block grant allocations, weekly reports) agencies are required to provide a feed (preferred: Atom 1.0, acceptable: RSS) of the information so that content can be delivered via subscription.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The document is very clear that the items in the feed can&#8217;t simply be unstructured text, but have to be reusable data, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Formula Block Grant Allocation Reports:</strong> Agencies are asked to provide Formula Block Grant Allocation information as soon as it becomes available. Data elements for the formula block grant allocation feed should include:</p>
<table><tr style="background-color: #ccc"><th style="text-align: center">Data Elements</th><th style="text-align: left">Description</th><th style="text-align: center">Field Type</th></tr> <tr><td>Recipient Name</td><td>The name of the recipient of the award.</td><td>varchar(45)</td></tr> <tr style="background-color: #eee"><td>Federal Funding Amount</td><td>Amount of federal government&#8217;s obligation or contingent liability, in dollars. A negative number represents a decrease in funding.</td><td>int(11)</td></tr> <tr><td>Recipient DUNS</td><td>Unique nine-digit number issued by Dun & Bradstreet to the agency. Followed by an optional DUNS Plus 4 which allows an agency to submit different bank account data for a single DUNS (Assigned by Dun & Bradstreet)</td><td>char(13)</td></tr> 
<tr><td colspan="3"><em>[&#8230;]</em></td></table>
</blockquote>

<p>And it goes on like this for several pages.</p>

<p>Pretty amazing to see a government so tech-savvy.</p>

<p>Excellent news. This should hopefully make citizen monitoring of government spending much easier: see http://yorksamerica.blogspot.com/2009/01/opening-up-compliance-checking.html</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested to know why Atom 1.0 is preferred to RSS - what reasons did you have for that choice?</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, but RSS is open form unstructured text.  The financial data disclosed won&#8217;t be easily recorded into structured databases, analyzed, and shared.</p>

<p>Actually, XML-based standards like XBRL would have been better than RSS because data disclosed in XBRL could be much more easily assimilated into analytical reports.</p>

<p>I updated the post to make it clearer that the data is structured.</p>

<p>Why did you choose to make the story about RSS when Atom is the preferred format?</p>

<p>Aaron, a few minutes ago, I tried to subscribe to the PCCC list via submission of the form on the <a href="http://boldprogressives.org/" rel="nofollow">page</a> to which you linked, but I received an error message that showed something about an incomplete form (I think I saw something about &#8220;do you want to volunteer?&#8221; flash) before being redirected to a <a href="http://boldprogressives.org/" rel="nofollow">Google Spreadsheets page</a> which informed me that &#8220;Something bad happened. Don&#8217;t worry, though. The Spreadsheets Team has been notified and we&#8217;ll get right on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Update: The PCCC homepage has a slightly-abbreviated version of the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pBWfhn_n-PC-TQkFtmXTPdA" rel="nofollow">form</a> that can be reached by following the &#8220;Stay in the loop with the PCCC&#8221; link on the homepage.  The abbreviated version is missing the &#8220;do you want to volunteer&#8221; question, and answering that question is mandatory for form submission.</p>
