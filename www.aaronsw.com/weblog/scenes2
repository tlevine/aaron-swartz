<h1>Scenes 2</h1>

<p>After a long delay, we&#8217;re finally allowed to board the plane. As we wait in line, the businessman in front of me takes out his phone and makes a call. &#8220;Hi, honey,&#8221; he says, apparently leaving a message. &#8220;We&#8217;re only boarding the plane just now, so I&#8217;ll probably be about an hour late. See you then.&#8221; He hangs up the phone and then dials again. &#8220;Hi, honey,&#8221; he says, in a similar voice. &#8220;We&#8217;re only boarding the plane just now, so I&#8217;ll probably be an hour and forty minutes late. See you then.&#8221;</p>

<p>A man paces his apartment in a robe. He lives on the penthouse suite of a modern residential building in an industrial section of Manhattan. He has the whole top floor; the elevator opens right into his apartment. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s left the place in days; for food, he orders delivery and pays at the elevator door. &#8220;Can you get me some pot?&#8221; he asks. He&#8217;s desperate for it. I give him a piece of paper with the number for a coke delivery service &#8212; &#8220;anytime, anywhere&#8221;. &#8220;Do you think they do weed too?&#8221; he asks. A copy of <em>Infinite Jest</em> lies unopened by his bed.</p>

<hr />

<p>There&#8217;s a cafe across the street that has the world&#8217;s most perfect corn muffins. But they only seem to stock just one each day. Every day, I carefully watch the clock: if I go there too early, I&#8217;m not particularly hungry; if I go there too late, I find them out of corn muffins and leave empty-handed. Finding the right minute is a constant struggle.</p>

<p>Today I show up and, as usual, there&#8217;s just one left. One clerk is getting it for me (I don&#8217;t even have to ask anymore; the clerks all know I always get just the corn muffin) while another is taking the order of the woman next to me. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have the&#8212;oh, he got the last one,&#8221; she says. She turns to me. &#8220;You got the best muffin!&#8221; She walks away empty-handed.</p>

<p>I missed your first post and was about to ask if you were experimenting with storytelling through vignettes here (related to your earlier post about writing).</p>

<p>I want to figure out why but I found the first scene here very easy to read and enjoyed it. The second one was harder to read and I didn&#8217;t really get it. The third one I found hard to read and so I just scanned it. If this wasn&#8217;t an experiment in telling a story through a vignette, though, these insights are probably next to pointless.. :)</p>
