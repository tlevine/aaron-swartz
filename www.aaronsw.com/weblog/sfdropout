<h1>Drop Out</h1>

<p>I was wondering what I was going to find for today&#8217;s Sunday Bonus Post. Luckily, at the last minute, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> stepped in to save me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aaron Swartz dropped out of high school after one year to study on his own. Then he dropped out of college after one year to seek his high-tech fortune. He was still in his teens a year later when he hit the jackpot, selling his startup in October to Wired Digital for an undisclosed but lottery-like payout.</p>
  
  <p>With his boyish mien and more geek credentials than engineers twice his age, the suddenly wealthy Swartz belongs to a new generation of young, brainy geeks who began booting up and logging on when their friends were still watching &#8220;Sesame Street.&#8221; Before they were old enough to drive, they landed paying gigs. Now that another high-tech boom is heating up Silicon Valley, more of these technologically developed but underage techies are dropping out and starting up.</p>
  
  <p>[&#8230;]</p>
  
  <p>&#8220;Everything that would get you detention at school will get you funding in Silicon Valley,&#8221; said Paul Saffo, a valley forecaster and essayist who has been exploring technological change and its impact on business and society for more than two decades.</p>
  
  <p>[&#8230;]</p>
  
  <p>Fancy new car? &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to drive,&#8221; Swartz wrote on his blog, Raw Thought. Big house in the suburbs? &#8220;I like living in small apartments.&#8221; Expensive clothes? &#8220;I&#8217;ve worn a T-shirt and jeans practically every day of my life.&#8221; Hanging with the cool kids? &#8220;I&#8217;m so shy I don&#8217;t even hang out with the people I know now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder what chance does a college dropout biotech prodigy have after leaving school and develpong some product. Not much. We are not at the bioDIY age yet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately biotech is not similar to infotech in that startup-dropout respect. You must have some credential, like a university degree, when your product is something with the human body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dude! haircut!&#8221;</p>

<p>No, absolutely not! Aaron&#8217;s hair is great and come do think of it &#8212; and I say this a non-homosexual male &#8212; he looks like a fashion model.</p>

<p>I hope that this comment is the most shallow one I&#8217;ll ever make on this blog :-)</p>
