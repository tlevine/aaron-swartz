<h1>Sweating the Small Stuff</h1>

<p>So <a href="http://jottit.com/">Jottit</a> has launched, only five months after I suggested to my friend Simon that we create a website that was just a big text box people could type stuff into. And there are two ways I look at it. One is: It took us five months to do <em>that</em>? And the other is: We did that in only five months?</p>

<p>When you look at what the site does, it seems pretty simple. It has few features, no complex algorithms, little gee-whiz gadgetry. It just takes your text and puts it on the Web. And considering how often I do that every day, it seems a bit odd that it took so long to create yet another way. And then I check the todo list.</p>

<p><a href="perfectionism">As I&#8217;ve said</a>, this is a site I wanted to get every little detail right on. And when you start sweating the small stuff, it&#8217;s frankly incredible just how much of it there is. Even our trivial site is made up of over two dozen different screens. Each one of those screens has to be designed to look and work just right on a wide variety of browsers, with a wide variety of text in them.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s just making things look good &#8212; making them work right is much harder. Each screen does, on average, five or six different things. And each of those things can be done under three or four different modes. Now we&#8217;re up to over 500 different things to do, each of which can have bugs in lots of unthought-of ways. And then, many of these pieces are exposed to users, who can do whatever they want with them &#8212; and do. If you&#8217;re building a site that accepts text from users, you need to think about something that lets some people just paste stuff from emails, others write HTML, others play YouTube videos, while others try to insert malicious text to break things for people.</p>

<p>There are lots of features we want to add to Jottit, but before we do any of that we want to make what we have work perfectly. And, at the moment, that means tasks as varied as reporting a bug in a piece of software we use to its developer, configuring the web server to display a nicer error message under certain odd conditions, having another computer monitor the first computer to see if it goes down, figuring out how to tweak the UI to make certain unclear things clearer to people, rewriting some of the text on the site to be nicer, creating a new site to inform our users of updates, making some stuff from our project open source, fixing stuff in other open source projects, testing the site on phones and weird browsers, examining an algorithm we use to see if it needs improvement, and fixing a bug that was just reported by a user. And those are just the things on <em>my</em> todo list!</p>

<p>When you look at it that way, it&#8217;s amazing anyone ever builds a website.</p>

<p>Youâ€™re definitely on the right track with the interface.  Every wiki, blog, review, social network, etc. site should be as easy to jump into (not to mention as clutter-free).</p>

<p>It seems a <i>bid</i> odd that you graduated from a top school, Delbert.  Just send your stuff over to Robert Morris to proofread before you publish it next time.  Actually, you&#8217;re just adding to the corpus of un-proofread websites with all this jotit stuff anyway.  Maybe as a paid service you could automatically forward everything to Robert Morris to proofread before publishing.  At least that would in fact be something.</p>

<p>@Bosco, it&#8217;s barely even Infogami 1.1.  And did you notice what happens if you click the Forgot Password link?  It sends you your original password.  Which means the passwords are stored in plain text.  Didn&#8217;t Aaron learn anything the <em>last</em> time a well-known database of passwords got stolen?  Evidently they didn&#8217;t cover hash functions and cryptographic responsibility in his Y Combinator seminars.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if anyone wants to set up a web page, I recommend WordPress.</p>

<p>It may be the case that Aaron and Simon are storing passwords as plaintext, but not storing them as a hash doesn&#8217;t prove they&#8217;re not encrypting them.</p>

<p>Aaron - congrats on the launch!</p>

<p>You are at a point now where you can literally launch a site with just a big text box, and it creates a huge blog buzz.</p>

<p>That kind of marketing firepower is pretty sweet &#8212; 1000s of other people out there could&#8217;ve put something like this together and it would not have been looked upon the same way, or generated nearly any buzz whatsoever.  Anyway, congrats on your reddit success (etc) &amp; the Jottit launch!</p>

<p>@Aaron: I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re fixing the password problem, but I&#8217;m alarmed that you released a product that has the problem, especially considering that you work(ed) for Reddit.  I can&#8217;t see a justification for ever storing plaintext passwords.</p>

<p>@Matt, the fact that it might be encrypted doesn&#8217;t help.  It&#8217;s physical computer theft we&#8217;re talking about here.</p>

<p>@Aaron: I have to admit, this thing is an improvement over the competition.  I was skeptical, but it does seem to be pretty close to the sweetspot.  You may have finally iPodified Geocities&#8230;</p>

<p>Outstanding. Regarding some earlier comments: I too would like to have an export option; and, I&#8217;m moving my stuff to Jottit <em>because</em> it enables Markdown rather than Textile &#8212; I&#8217;ve always been annoyed by the Textile markup on Backpack pages, because in several other contexts I use Markdown. Also, I&#8217;m just a wee bit concerned lest somewhere down the line I&#8217;ve added twenty pages and find out that I&#8217;ll now have to start paying for them&#8230; .</p>

<p>@Eric, I&#8217;m not convinced that the ability to decrypt users&#8217; passwords is the largest concern when a physical theft occurs.  Who needs a user&#8217;s password when all their data is already accessible.</p>

<p>Suppose hashing is still the simplest and safest representation for storage, but it&#8217;s a hassle having to copy and paste a temporary password and then set a new password.</p>
