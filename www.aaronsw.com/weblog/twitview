<h1>My Twitter Viewer</h1>

<p>I published this <a href="http://twitter.com/aaronsw">on Twitter</a>, but here&#8217;s a blog post as well:</p>

<p>I made a little <a href="http://twitter.theinfo.org/">Twitter viewer</a> that takes a Tweet ID (you can find them in the URL of a tweet&#8217;s page on twitter.com) and shows you the whole conversation for that tweet.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.theinfo.org/20496113098301440">Glenn Greenwald on the insurance file</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.theinfo.org/21994946588319745">The epic Ptacek-Kaminsky debate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.theinfo.org/20293552433004544">Kevin Poulsen explains what&#8217;s not in the logs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to a) make it easier to read these conversations, b) make it easier to provide replies, c) provide a permanent link to what&#8217;s becoming an increasingly-important conversation space.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s absurd that Twitter doesn&#8217;t provide this service itself.</p>

<p>Very nice. I found myself looking for time of day on the tweets to see how much time had elapsed between the various messages.</p>

<p>Nice work Aaron!</p>

<p>I actually built the same thing a year ago at http://twitlr.com/ but it was before the related_results method was available in the API so it&#8217;s very hacky and only supports a single thread.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t believe Twitter still don&#8217;t provide a UI for conversation threading. The #newtwitter interface does show you the preceding tweet in a conversation but that&#8217;s it. I guess they&#8217;re happy enough to let client applications implement it.</p>

<p>Nice! There’s http://www.exquisitetweets.com/ which does almost exactly the same and let’s you create random collections of tweets, but it’s a little slow sometimes due to loading lots of background images.</p>

<p>I’ve seen other services that try to do this, and all of them so far have had a fatal shortcoming: if @tom writes multiple replies to a single one of @harry’s tweets, then the tool finds only one of them. So you get only a shard of the actual conversation. This is further compounded if @harry then responds to tweets from @tom that the tool didn’t detect as part of the conversation. Sometimes the thread shown is so incomplete as to be completely useless.</p>

<p>Does yours handle this situation?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just so much work having to a.)open the time stamp link in a new tab, b.) copy the Tweet ID from the url c.) go the Twitter conversation viewer page and d.) paste the Tweet ID into the box. Couldn&#8217;t you make a Fire Fox extension that I could just right click the the time stamp and select a menu item that would open a tab with the url &#8220;http://twitter.theinfo.org/&#8221; appended with the Tweet ID in a new tab?</p>

<p>This is also my complaint for every time that I have used it, I get a message saying that I should complain to you.</p>

<p>But seriously, I am trying to make such an extension in my own slow way. It seems like an easy enough idea to start with. I doubt if any thing I came up with would suit anyone. However if you came up with one, you could probably make some money from ads. If not on the conversation page, from a page that would appear every time the extension was updated.</p>

<p>I saw this tool mentioned on Twitter and I quite like it, Aaron.  Thanks for putting it together and making it available.</p>

<p>One immediate minor upgrade I&#8217;d like to see: allow the user to supply the permalink for the tweet in question and have your software pull the Tweet ID out of that.  Far easier for a human (well, me, anyway) to be reading my twitter stream, find a tweet where I&#8217;d like to see the whole conversation, right-click and copy the link, and then open your site in a new tab, say, from a bookmark.</p>

<p>I grant that your bookmarklet already does a lot of this; e.g., if I open the particular tweet in the new tab and then click your bookmarklet, but even though the first process sounds more complicated, it&#8217;s the more natural way I think of doing something like this.  Don&#8217;t make me think, as the saying goes.</p>

<p>I agree with James Hardy above that it&#8217;d be even handier to have a Firefox extension to further streamline the process, but the request I&#8217;m making seems considerably quicker and easier to implement.  (Perhaps in the meantime, if you&#8217;re thinking about doing more work on this.)</p>

<p>I meant to add another minor gripe I have with the bookmarklet:  Call me obsessive, but browser screen real estate is always at a premium for me, particularly vertically.  Therefore, I dislike having to have the bookmark toolbar in Firefox showing.</p>
